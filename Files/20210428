Biden</h2>\n\t\t\t<h3>April 28, 2021</h3>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p>\nMadame Speaker.</p>\n\n<p>Madame Vice President.</p>\n\n<p>No president has ever said those words from this podium, and it\'s about\ntime.</p>\n\n<p>The First Lady.</p>\n\n<p>The Second Gentleman.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Chief Justice.</p>\n\n<p>Members of the United States Congress and the Cabinet -- and\ndistinguished guests.</p>\n\n<p>My fellow Americans.</p>\n\n<p>While the setting tonight is familiar, this gathering is very different\n-- a reminder of the extraordinary times we are in.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout our history, Presidents have come to this chamber to speak to\nthe Congress, to the nation, and to the world.</p>\n\n<p>To declare war. To celebrate peace. To announce new plans and\npossibilities.</p>\n\n<p>Tonight, I come to talk about crisis -- and opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>About rebuilding our nation -- and revitalizing our democracy.</p>\n\n<p>And winning the future for America.</p>\n\n<p>As I stand here tonight -- just one day shy of the 100th day of my\nadministration.</p>\n\n<p>100 days since I took the oath of office, lifted my hand off our family\nBible, and inherited a nation in crisis.</p>\n\n<p>The worst pandemic in a century.</p>\n\n<p>The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.</p>\n\n<p>The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.</p>\n\n<p>Now, after just 100 days, I can report to the nation: America is on the\nmove again.</p>\n\n<p>Turning peril into possibility. Crisis into opportunity. Setback into\nstrength.</p>\n\n<p>Life can knock us down.</p>\n\n<p>But in America, we never stay down.</p>\n\n<p>In America, we always get up.</p>\n\n<p>And today, that\'s what we\'re doing: America is rising anew.</p>\n\n<p>Choosing hope over fear. Truth over lies. Light over darkness.</p>\n\n<p>After 100 Days of rescue and renewal, America is ready for takeoff.</p>\n\n<p>We are working again. Dreaming again. Discovering again. Leading the\nworld again.</p>\n\n<p>We have shown each other and the world: There is no quit in America.</p>\n\n<p>100 days ago, America\'s house was on fire.</p>\n\n<p>We had to act.</p>\n\n<p>And thanks to the extraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi and\nMajority Leader Schumer -- and with the overwhelming support of the\nAmerican people -- Democrats, Independents, and Republicans -- we did\nact.</p>\n\n<p>Together -- we passed the American Rescue Plan.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most consequential rescue packages in American history.</p>\n\n<p>We\'re already seeing the results.</p>\n\n<p>After I promised 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots in 100 days -- we\nwill have provided over 220 million COVID shots in 100 days.</p>\n\n<p>We\'re marshalling every federal resource. We\'ve gotten the vaccine to\nnearly 40,000 pharmacies and over 700 community health centers.</p>\n\n<p>We\'re setting up community vaccination sites, and are deploying mobile\nunits into hard-to-reach areas.</p>\n\n<p>Today, 90% of Americans now live within 5 miles of a vaccination site.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone over the age of 16, everyone -- is now eligible and can get\nvaccinated right away.</p>\n\n<p>So get vaccinated now.</p>\n\n<p>When I was sworn in, less than 1% of seniors were fully vaccinated\nagainst COVID-19.</p>\n\n<p>100 days later, nearly 70% of seniors are fully protected.</p>\n\n<p>Senior deaths from COVID-19 are down 80% since January. Down 80%.</p>\n\n<p>And, more than half of all adults in America have gotten at least one\nshot.</p>\n\n<p>At a mass vaccination center in Glendale, Arizona, I asked a nurse what\nit\'s like.</p>\n\n<p>She looked and said every shot feels like a dose of hope.</p>\n\n<p>A dose of hope for the educator in Florida who has a child who suffers\nfrom an auto-immune disease.</p>\n\n<p>She wrote to me that she was worried about bringing the virus home.</p>\n\n<p>When she got vaccinated, she sat in her car and just cried.</p>\n\n<p>Cried out of joy, cried out of relief.</p>\n\n<p>Parents are seeing smiles on their kids\' faces as they go back to school\nbecause teachers and school bus drivers, cafeteria workers have been\nvaccinated.</p>\n\n<p>Grandparents hugging their children and grandchildren instead of\npressing their hands against a window to say goodbye</p>\n\n<p>It means everything to both of them.</p>\n\n<p>There\'s still more work to do to beat this virus. We can\'t let our guard\ndown now.</p>\n\n<p>But tonight, I can say because of you -- the American people -- our\nprogress these past 100 days against one of the worst pandemics in\nhistory is one of the greatest logistical achievements our country has\never seen.</p>\n\n<p>What else have we done these first 100 days?</p>\n\n<p>We kept our commitment and we are sending $1,400 rescue checks to 85% of\nall American households.</p>\n\n<p>We\'ve already sent more than 160 million checks out the door.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s making a difference.</p>\n\n<p>For many people, it\'s making all the difference in the world.</p>\n\n<p>A single mom in Texas wrote to me.</p>\n\n<p>She said when she couldn\'t work, this relief check put food on the table</p>\n\n<p>and saved her and her son from eviction.</p>\n\n<p>A grandmother in Virginia told me she immediately took her granddaughter\nto the eye doctor -- something she put off for months because she didn\'t\nhave the money.</p>\n\n<p>One of the defining images of this crisis has been cars lined up for\nmiles waiting for a box of food to be put in the trunk.</p>\n\n<p>Did you ever think you\'d see that in America?</p>\n\n<p>That\'s why the American Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition\nassistance to millions of Americans facing hunger -- and hunger is down\nsharply already.</p>\n\n<p>We\'re also providing:</p>\n\n<p>Rental assistance to keep people from being evicted from their homes.\nProviding loans to keep small businesses open and their employees on the\njob.</p>\n\n<p>During these 100 days, an additional 800,000 Americans enrolled in the\nAffordable Care Act because I established a special sign up period to do\nthat.</p>\n\n<p>We\'re making one of the largest one-time investments ever in improving\nhealth care for veterans.</p>\n\n<p>Critical investments to address the opioid crisis.</p>\n\n<p>And, maybe most importantly, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we are\non track to cut child poverty in America in half this year.</p>\n\n<p>In the process, the economy created more than 1.3 million new jobs in\n100 days.</p>\n\n<p>More new jobs in the first 100 days than any president on record.</p>\n\n<p>The International Monetary Fund is now estimating our economy will grow\nat a rate of more than 6% this year.</p>\n\n<p>That will be the fastest pace of economic growth in this country in\nnearly four decades.</p>\n\n<p>America is moving. Moving forward. And we can\'t stop now.</p>\n\n<p>We\'re in a competition with China and other countries to win the 21st\nCentury.</p>\n\n<p>We have to do more than just build back. We have to build back better.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout our history, public investments and infrastructure have\ntransformed America.</p>\n\n<p>The transcontinental railroad and interstate highways united two oceans\nand brought us into a totally new age of progress.</p>\n\n<p>Universal public school and college aid opened wide the doors of\nopportunity.</p>\n\n<p>Scientific breakthroughs took us to the Moon and now to Mars, discovered\nvaccines, and gave us the Internet and so much more.</p>\n\n<p>These are the investments we make together, as one country, and that\nonly government can make.</p>\n\n<p>\nTime and again, they propel us into the future.</p>\n\n<p>That\'s why I proposed The American Jobs Plan -- a once-in-a-generation\ninvestment in America itself.</p>\n\n<p>The largest jobs plan since World War II.</p>\n\n<p>It creates jobs to upgrade our transportation infrastructure. Jobs\nmodernizing roads, bridges and highways. Jobs building ports and\nairports, rail corridors and transit lines. It\'s clean water.</p>\n\n<p>Today, up to 10 million homes and more than 400,000 schools and child\ncare centers have pipes with lead in them, including for drinking water.</p>\n\n<p> A clear and present danger to our children\'s health.</p>\n\n<p>The American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100% of the nation\'s lead\npipes and service lines so every American, so every child -- can turn on\nthe faucet and be certain to drink clean water.</p>\n\n<p>It creates jobs connecting every American with high-speed internet,\nincluding 35% of rural Americans who still don\'t have it.</p>\n\n<p>This will help our kids and businesses succeed in a 21st Century\neconomy.</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd I am asking the Vice President to help lead this effort.</p>\n\n<p>It creates jobs by building a modern power grid.</p>\n\n<p>Our grids are vulnerable to storms, hacks, and catastrophic failures --\nwith tragic results as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during winter\nstorms.</p>\n\n<p>The American Jobs Plan will create jobs to lay thousands of miles of\ntransmission lines needed to build a resilient and fully clean grid.</p>\n\n<p>The American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their\njobs and their careers.</p>\n\n<p>2 million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic,\ntoo often because they couldn\'t get the care they need for their family,\ntheir children.</p>\n\n<p>800,000 families are on a Medicaid waiting list right now to get\nhomecare for their aging parent or loved one with a disability.</p>\n\n<p>This plan will help these families and create jobs for our caregivers\nwith better wages and better benefits.</p>\n\n<p>For too long, we have failed to use the most important word when it\ncomes to meeting the climate crisis.</p>\n\n<p>Jobs. Jobs.</p>\n\n<p>For me, when I think about climate change, I think jobs.</p>\n\n<p>The American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to\nwork building more energy efficient buildings and homes.</p>\n\n<p>Electrical workers installing 500,000 charging stations along our\nhighways.</p>\n\n<p>Farmers planting cover crops, so they can reduce carbon dioxide in the\nair and get paid for doing it.</p>\n\n<p>There\'s no reason the blades for wind turbines can\'t be built in\nPittsburgh instead of Beijing.</p>\n\n<p>No reason why American workers can\'t lead the world in the production of\nelectric vehicles and batteries.</p>\n\n<p>The American Jobs Plan will create millions of good paying jobs -- jobs\nAmericans can raise their families on.</p>\n\n<p>And all the investments in the American Jobs Plan will be guided by one\nprinciple: "Buy American."</p>\n\n<p>American tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made\nin America that create American jobs.</p>\n\n<p>The way it should be.</p>\n\n<p>Now -- I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are\nfor you.</p>\n\n<p>You feel left behind and forgotten in an economy that\'s rapidly\nchanging.</p>\n\n<p>Let me speak directly to you.</p>\n\n<p>Independent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of\njobs and trillions of dollars in economic growth for years to come.</p>\n\n<p>These are good-paying jobs that can\'t be outsourced.</p>\n\n<p>Nearly 90% of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan\ndo not require a college degree.</p>\n\n<p>75% do not require an associate\'s degree.</p>\n\n<p>The American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to build America.</p>\n\n<p>And, it recognizes something I\'ve always said.</p>\n\n<p>Wall Street didn\'t build this country. The middle class built this\ncountry. And unions build the middle class.</p>\n\n<p>And that\'s why I\'m calling on Congress to pass the Protecting the Right\nto Organize Act -- the PRO Act -- and send it to my desk to support the\nright to unionize.</p>\n\n<p>By the way -- let\'s also pass the $15 minimum wage.</p>\n\n<p>No one should work 40 hours a week and still live below the poverty\nline.</p>\n\n<p>And we need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women.</p>\n\n<p>Let\'s get the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk for equal pay.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s long past time.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in\nnon-defense research and development on record.</p>\n\n<p>We will see more technological change in the next 10 years -- than we\nsaw in the last 50 years.</p>\n\n<p>And we\'re falling behind in that competition.</p>\n\n<p>Decades ago we used to invest 2% of our GDP on research and development.</p>\n\n<p>Today, we spend less than 1%.</p>\n\n<p>China and other countries are closing in fast.</p>\n\n<p>We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the\nfuture: advanced batteries, biotechnology, computer chips, and clean\nenergy.</p>\n\n<p>The Defense Department has an agency called DARPA -- the Defense\nAdvanced Research Projects Agency -- that\'s there to develop\nbreakthroughs to enhance our national security -- which led to the\ninternet and GPS and so much more.</p>\n\n<p>The National Institutes of Health, the NIH -- should create a similar\nAdvanced Research Projects Agency for health.</p>\n\n<p>\nTo develop breakthroughs -- to prevent, detect, and treat diseases like\nAlzheimer\'s, diabetes, and cancer.</p>\n\n<p>This is personal to so many of us.</p>\n\n<p>I can think of no more worthy investment. And I know of nothing that is\nmore bipartisan.</p>\n\n<p>Let\'s end cancer as we know it. It\'s within our power</p>\n\n<p>Investments in jobs and infrastructure like the ones we\'re talking about\nhave often had bipartisan support.</p>\n\n<p>Vice President Harris and I meet regularly in the Oval Office with\nDemocrats and Republicans to discuss the American Jobs Plan.</p>\n\n<p>And I applaud a group of Republican Senators who just put forward their\nproposal.</p>\n\n<p>So, let\'s get to work.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>We welcome ideas.</p>\n\n<p>But, the rest of the world isn\'t waiting for us. Doing nothing is not an\noption.</p>\n\n<p>We can\'t be so busy competing with each other that we forget the\ncompetition is with the rest of the world to win the 21st Century.</p>\n\n<p>\nTo win that competition for the future, we also need to make a\nonce-in-a-generation investment in our families -- in our children.</p>\n\n<p>That\'s why I\'m introducing the American Families Plan tonight, which\naddresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families today.</p>\n\n<p>First, access to a good education.</p>\n\n<p>When this nation made 12 years of public education universal in the last\ncentury, it made us the best-educated and best-prepared nation in the\nworld.</p>\n\n<p>But the world is catching up. They are not waiting.</p>\n\n<p>12 years is no longer enough today to compete in the 21st Century.</p>\n\n<p>That\'s why the American Families Plan guarantees four additional years\nof public education for every person in America -- starting as early as\nwe can.</p>\n\n<p>We add two years of universal high-quality pre-school for every 3- and\n4- year-old in America.</p>\n\n<p>The research shows that when a young child goes to school--not day\ncare--they are far more likely to graduate from high school and go on to\ncollege.</p>\n\n<p>And then we add two years of free community college.</p>\n\n<p>And we will increase Pell Grants and investment in Historically Black\nColleges and Universities, Tribal colleges, and minority-serving\ninstitutions.</p>\n\n<p>Jill is a community college professor who teaches today as First Lady.</p>\n\n<p>She has long said any country that out-educates us is going to\noutcompete us -- and she\'ll be leading this effort.</p>\n\n<p>Second, the American Families plan will provide access to quality,\naffordable child care.</p>\n\n<p>We guarantee that low- to middle-income families will pay no more than\n7% of their income for high-quality care for children up to the age of\n5.</p>\n\n<p>The most hard-pressed working families won\'t have to spend a dime.</p>\n\n<p>Third, the American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of\npaid family and medical leave.</p>\n\n<p>No one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care\nof themselves and a loved one -- a parent, spouse, or child.</p>\n\n<p>And fourth, the American Families Plan puts money directly into the\npockets of millions of families.</p>\n\n<p>In March we expanded a tax credit for every child in a family.</p>\n\n<p>Up to a $3,000 Child Tax Credit for children over 6 -- and $3,600 for\nchildren under 6.</p>\n\n<p>With two parents, two kids, that\'s up to $7,200 in your pocket to help\ntake care of your family.</p>\n\n<p>This will help more than 65 million children and help cut child poverty\nin half this year.</p>\n\n<p>Together, let\'s extend the Child Tax Credit at least through the end of\n2025.</p>\n\n<p>The American Rescue Plan lowered health care premiums for 9 million\nAmericans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n\n<p>Let\'s make that provision permanent so their premiums don\'t go back up.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to my Families Plan, I will work with Congress to address --\nthis year -- other critical priorities for America\'s families.</p>\n\n<p>The Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans\n--protecting people with pre-existing conditions, protecting women\'s\nhealth.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>And the pandemic has demonstrated how badly it is needed.</p>\n\n<p>Let\'s lower deductibles for working families on the Affordable Care Act,\nand let\'s lower prescription drug costs.</p>\n\n<p>We all know how outrageously expensive they are.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices in the world right\nhere in America -- nearly three times as much as other countries.</p>\n\n<p>We can change that.</p>\n\n<p>Let\'s do what we\'ve always talked about.</p>\n\n<p>Let\'s give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by\nnegotiating lower prices for prescription drugs.</p>\n\n<p>That won\'t just help people on Medicare -- it will lower prescription\ndrug costs for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>The money we save can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act -- expand\nMedicare coverage and benefits -- without costing taxpayers one\nadditional penny.</p>\n\n<p>We\'ve talked about it long enough -- Democrats and Republicans.</p>\n\n<p>Let\'s get it done this year.</p>\n\n<p>This is all about a simple premise: Health care should be a right, not a\nprivilege in America.</p>\n\n<p>So how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plans?</p>\n\n<p>I\'ve made clear that we can do it without increasing deficits.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Let\'s start with what I will not do.</p>\n\n<p>I will not impose any tax increases on people making less than $400,000\na year.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1% of Americans to\npay their fair share.</p>\n\n<p>Just pay their fair share.</p>\n\n<p>A recent study shows that 55 of the nation\'s biggest corporations paid\nzero in federal income tax last year.</p>\n\n<p>No federal taxes on more than $40 billion in profits.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of companies evade taxes through tax havens from Switzerland to\nBermuda to the Cayman Islands.</p>\n\n<p>And they benefit from tax loopholes and deductions that allow for\noffshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas.</p>\n\n<p>That\'s not right.</p>\n\n<p>We\'re going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share --\nand help pay for the public investments their businesses will benefit\nfrom.</p>\n\n<p>And, we\'re going to reward work, not wealth.</p>\n\n<p>We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1% of Americans -- those\nmaking $400,000 or more -- back up to 39.6%.</p>\n\n<p>We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1% of Americans -- those\nmaking $400,000 or more -- back up to 39.6%.</p>\n\n<p>That\'s where it was when George W. Bush became president.</p>\n\n<p>We\'re going to get rid of the loopholes that allow Americans who make\nmore than $1 million a year pay a lower rate on their capital gains than\nworking Americans pay on their work.</p>\n\n<p>This will only affect three tenths of 1% of all Americans.</p>\n\n<p>And the IRS will crack down on millionaires and billionaires who cheat\non their taxes.</p>\n\n<p>That\'s estimated to be billions of dollars.</p>\n\n<p>Look, I\'m not out to punish anyone.</p>\n\n<p>But I will not add to the tax burden of the middle class of this\ncountry.</p>\n\n<p>\nThey\'re already paying enough.</p>\n\n<p>What I\'ve proposed is fair. It\'s fiscally responsible.</p>\n\n<p>\nIt raises the revenue to pay for the plans I\'ve proposed that will\ncreate millions of jobs and grow the economy.</p>\n\n<p>When you hear someone say that they don\'t want to raise taxes on the\nwealthiest 1% and on corporate America -- ask them: whose taxes are you\ngoing to raise instead, and whose are you going to cut?</p>\n\n<p>Look at the big tax cut in 2017.</p>\n\n<p>It was supposed to pay for itself and generate vast economic growth.</p>\n\n<p>Instead it added $2 trillion to the deficit.</p>\n\n<p>It was a huge windfall for corporate America and those at the very top.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of using the tax savings to raise wages and invest in research\nand development -- it poured billions of dollars into the pockets of\nCEOs.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, the pay gap between CEOs and their workers is now among the\nlargest in history.</p>\n\n<p>According to one study, CEOs make 320 times what their average workers\nmake.</p>\n\n<p>The pandemic has only made things worse.</p>\n\n<p>20 million Americans lost their jobs in the pandemic -- working- and\nmiddle-class Americans.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, the roughly 650 Billionaires in America saw their net\nworth increase by more than $1 Trillion.</p>\n\n<p>Let me say that again.</p>\n\n<p>Just 650 people increased their wealth by more than $1 Trillion during\nthis pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>\nThey are now worth more than $4 Trillion.</p>\n\n<p>My fellow Americans, trickle-down economics has never worked.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s time to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle-out.</p>\n\n<p>A broad consensus of economists -- left, right, center -- agree that\nwhat I\'m proposing will help create millions of jobs and generate\nhistoric economic growth.</p>\n\n<p>These are among the highest value investments we can make as a nation.</p>\n\n<p>I\'ve often said that our greatest strength is the power of our example\n-- not just the example of our power.</p>\n\n<p>And in my conversations with world leaders -- many I\'ve known for a long\ntime -- the comment I hear most often is: we see that America is back --\nbut for how long?</p>\n\n<p>My fellow Americans, we have to show not just that we are back, but that\nwe are here to stay.</p>\n\n<p>And that we aren\'t going it alone -- we\'re going to be leading with our\nallies.</p>\n\n<p>No one nation can deal with all the crises of our time alone -- from\nterrorism to nuclear proliferation to mass migration, cybersecurity,\nclimate change -- and as we\'re experiencing now, pandemics.</p>\n\n<p>There\'s no wall high enough to keep any virus away.</p>\n\n<p>As our own vaccine supply grows to meet our needs -- and we are meeting\nthem -- we will become an arsenal of vaccines for other countries --\njust as America was the arsenal of democracy in World War 2.</p>\n\n<p>The climate crisis is not our fight alone, either.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s a global fight.</p>\n\n<p>The United States accounts for less than 15% of carbon emissions.</p>\n\n<p>The rest of the world accounts for 85%.</p>\n\n<p>That\'s why -- I kept my commitment to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement\non my first day in office.</p>\n\n<p>And I kept my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in\nAmerica, with all of the major economies of the world -- from China and\nRussia to India and the European Union in my first 100 days.</p>\n\n<p>I wanted the world to see that there is consensus that we are at an\ninflection point in history.</p>\n\n<p>And the consensus is if we act, we can save the planet -- and we can\ncreate millions of jobs and economic growth and opportunity to raise the\nstandard of living for everyone in the world.</p>\n\n<p>The investments I\'ve proposed tonight also advance a foreign policy that\nbenefits the middle class.</p>\n\n<p>That means making sure every nation plays by the same rules in the\nglobal economy, including China.</p>\n\n<p>In my discussion with President Xi, I told him that we welcome the\ncompetition -- and that we are not looking for conflict.</p>\n\n<p>But I made absolutely clear that I will defend American interests across\nthe board.</p>\n\n<p>America will stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American\nworkers and industries, like subsidies for state-owned enterprises and\nthe theft of American technologies and intellectual property.</p>\n\n<p>I also told President Xi that we will maintain a strong military\npresence in the Indo--Pacific just as we do with NATO in Europe -- not\nto start conflict -- but to prevent conflict.</p>\n\n<p>And, I told him what I\'ve said to many world leaders -- that America\nwon\'t back away from our commitment to human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms.</p>\n\n<p>No responsible American president can remain silent when basic human\nrights are violated. A president has to represent the essence of our\ncountry.</p>\n\n<p>America is an idea -- unique in the world.</p>\n\n<p>We are all created equal. It\'s who we are. We cannot walk away from that\nprinciple.</p>\n\n<p>With regard to Russia, I made very clear to President Putin that while\nwe don\'t seek escalation, their actions have consequences.</p>\n\n<p>I responded in a direct and proportionate way to Russia\'s interference\nin our elections and cyber--attacks on our government and businesses --\nand they did both of those things and I did respond.</p>\n\n<p>But we can also cooperate when it\'s in our mutual interests.</p>\n\n<p>As we did when we extended the New START Treaty on nuclear arms -- and\nas we\'re working to do on the climate crisis.</p>\n\n<p>On Iran and North Korea\'s nuclear programs that present a serious threat\nto America\'s security and world security -- we will be working closely\nwith our allies to address the threats posed by both of these countries\nthrough diplomacy and stern deterrence.</p>\n\n<p>And American leadership means ending the forever war in Afghanistan.</p>\n\n<p>We have the greatest fighting force in the history of the world.</p>\n\n<p>And I\'m the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have\nhad a child serving in a warzone.</p>\n\n<p>Today we have service members serving in the same war as their parents\nonce did.</p>\n\n<p>We have service members in Afghanistan who were not yet born on 9/11.</p>\n\n<p>War in Afghanistan was never meant to be a multi--generational\nundertaking of nation--building.</p>\n\n<p>We went to Afghanistan to get the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11.</p>\n\n<p>We delivered justice to Osama Bin Laden and we degraded the terrorist\nthreat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan.</p>\n\n<p>After 20 years of American valor and sacrifice, it\'s time to bring our\ntroops home.</p>\n\n<p>Even as we do, we will maintain an over--the--horizon capability to\nsuppress future threats to the homeland.</p>\n\n<p>But make no mistake -- the terrorist threat has evolved beyond\nAfghanistan since 2001 and we will remain vigilant against threats to\nthe United States, wherever they come from.</p>\n\n<p>Al Qaeda and ISIS are in Yemen, Syria, Somalia, and other places in\nAfrica and the Middle East and beyond.</p>\n\n<p>And, we won\'t ignore what our own intelligence agencies have determined\n-- the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today is from white\nsupremacist terrorism.</p>\n\n<p>And my fellow Americans, we must come together to heal the soul of this\nnation.</p>\n\n<p>It was nearly a year ago before her father\'s funeral, when I spoke with\nGianna Floyd, George Floyd\'s young daughter.</p>\n\n<p>As I knelt down to talk to her so we could talk eye--to--eye, she said\nto me, "Daddy changed the world."</p>\n\n<p>After the conviction of George Floyd\'s murderer, we can see how right\nshe was -- if we have the courage to act.</p>\n\n<p>We have all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black America.</p>\n\n<p>Now is our opportunity to make real progress.</p>\n\n<p>Most men and women in uniform wear their badge and serve their\ncommunities honorably.</p>\n\n<p>I know them. I know they want to help meet this moment as well.</p>\n\n<p>My fellow Americans, we have to come together.</p>\n\n<p>To rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve.</p>\n\n<p>To root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system.</p>\n\n<p>And to enact police reform in George Floyd\'s name that passed the House\nalready.</p>\n\n<p>I know the Republicans have their own ideas and are engaged in\nproductive discussions with Democrats.</p>\n\n<p>We need to work together to find a consensus.</p>\n\n<p>Let\'s get it done next month, by the first anniversary of George Floyd\'s\ndeath.</p>\n\n<p>The country supports this reform.</p>\n\n<p>Congress should act.</p>\n\n<p>We have a giant opportunity to bend to the arc of the moral universe\ntoward justice.</p>\n\n<p>Real justice.</p>\n\n<p>And with the plans I outlined tonight, we have a real chance to root out\nsystemic racism that plagues American life in many other ways.</p>\n\n<p>A chance to deliver real equity.</p>\n\n<p>Good jobs and good schools. Affordable housing. Clean air and clean\nwater.</p>\n\n<p>Being able to generate wealth and pass it down through generations.</p>\n\n<p>Real opportunities in the lives of more Americans -- Black, white,\nLatino, Asian American, Native American.</p>\n\n<p>I also want to thank the Senate for voting 94--1 to pass the COVID--19\nHate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders from\nthe vicious hate crimes we\'ve seen this past year -- and for too long.</p>\n\n<p>I urge the House to do the same and send that legislation to my desk as\nsoon as possible.</p>\n\n<p>I also hope Congress can get to my desk the Equality Act to protect the\nrights of LGBTQ Americans.</p>\n\n<p>To all the transgender Americans watching at home -- especially the\nyoung people who are so brave -- I want you to know that your president\nhas your back.</p>\n\n<p>And another thing.</p>\n\n<p>Let\'s reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which has been law in\nthis country for 27 years since I first wrote it.</p>\n\n<p>It will close the so--called "boyfriend" loophole to keep guns out of\nthe hands of abusers.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s estimated that more than 50 women are shot and killed by an\nintimate partner -- every month in America.</p>\n\n<p>Pass it and save lives.</p>\n\n<p>And I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is an epidemic in\nAmerica.</p>\n\n<p>Our flag at the White House was still flying at half--staff for the 8\nvictims of the mass shooting in Georgia, when 10 more lives were taken\nin a mass shooting in Colorado.</p>\n\n<p>In the week between those mass shootings, more than 250 other Americans\nwere shot dead.</p>\n\n<p>250 shot dead.</p>\n\n<p>I know how hard it is to make progress on this issue.</p>\n\n<p>In the 1990s, we passed universal background checks and a ban on assault\nweapons and high--capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be\nfired in seconds.</p>\n\n<p>We beat the NRA. Mass shootings and gun violence declined.</p>\n\n<p>But in the early 2000\'s, that law expired and we\'ve seen the daily\nbloodshed since.</p>\n\n<p>More than two weeks ago in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the\nbravest people I know -- the survivors and families who lost loved ones\nto gun violence -- I laid out several steps the Department of Justice is\ntaking to end this epidemic.</p>\n\n<p>One of them is banning so--called "ghost guns."</p>\n\n<p>They are homemade guns built from a kit that includes the directions on\nhow to finish the firearm.</p>\n\n<p>The parts have no serial numbers, so when they show up at a crime scene,\nthey can\'t be traced.</p>\n\n<p>The buyers of ghost gun kits aren\'t required to pass a background check.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone from a criminal to a terrorist could buy this kit and, in as\nlittle as 30 minutes, put together a lethal weapon.</p>\n\n<p>But not anymore.</p>\n\n<p>I will do everything in my power to protect the American people from\nthis epidemic of gun violence.</p>\n\n<p>But it\'s time for Congress to act as well.</p>\n\n<p>We need more Senate Republicans to join with the overwhelming majority\nof their Democratic colleagues, and close loopholes and require\nbackground checks to purchase a gun.</p>\n\n<p>And we need a ban on assault weapons and high--capacity magazines again.</p>\n\n<p>Don\'t tell me it can\'t be done. We\'ve done it before  and it worked.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Talk to most responsible gun owners, most hunters -- they\'ll tell you\nthere\'s no possible justification for having 100 rounds -- 100 bullets\n-- in a weapon.</p>\n\n<p>They will tell you that there are too many people today who are able to\nbuy a gun, but who shouldn\'t be able to.</p>\n\n<p>These kinds of reasonable reforms have the overwhelming support of the\nAmerican people -- including many gun owners.</p>\n\n<p>The country supports reform, and the Congress should act.</p>\n\n<p>This shouldn\'t be a Red vs. Blue issue. It\'s an American issue.</p>\n\n<p>And here\'s what else we can do.</p>\n\n<p>Immigration has always been essential to America.</p>\n\n<p>Let\'s end our exhausting war over immigration.</p>\n\n<p>For more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform\nand done nothing about it.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s time to fix it.</p>\n\n<p>On day one of my Presidency, I kept my commitment and I sent a\ncomprehensive immigration bill to Congress.</p>\n\n<p>If you believe we need a secure border -- pass it.</p>\n\n<p>If you believe in a pathway to citizenship -- pass it.</p>\n\n<p>If you actually want to solve the problem -- I have sent you a bill, now\npass it.</p>\n\n<p>We also have to get at the root of the problem of why people are fleeing\nto our southern border from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador.</p>\n\n<p>The violence. The corruption. The gangs. The political instability.\nHunger. Hurricanes. Earthquakes.</p>\n\n<p>When I was Vice President, I focused on providing the help needed to\naddress these root causes of migration.</p>\n\n<p>It helped keep people in their own countries instead of being forced to\nleave.</p>\n\n<p>Our plan worked.</p>\n\n<p>But the last administration shut it down.</p>\n\n<p>I\'m restoring the program and asked Vice President Harris to lead our\ndiplomatic efforts.</p>\n\n<p>I have absolute confidence she will get the job done.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if Congress won\'t pass my plan -- let\'s at least pass what we agree\non.</p>\n\n<p>Congress needs to pass legislation this year to finally secure\nprotection for the Dreamers -- the young people who have only known\nAmerica as their home.</p>\n\n<p>And, permanent protections for immigrants on temporary protected status\nwho come from countries beset by man--made and natural made violence and\ndisaster.</p>\n\n<p>As well as a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers who put food on our\ntables.</p>\n\n<p>Immigrants have done so much for America during the pandemic -- as they\nhave throughout our history.</p>\n\n<p>The country supports immigration reform.</p>\n\n<p>Congress should act.</p>\n\n<p>And if we are to truly restore the soul of America -- we need to protect\nthe sacred right to vote.</p>\n\n<p>More people voted in the last presidential election than ever before in\nour history -- in the middle of one of the worst pandemics ever.</p>\n\n<p>That should be celebrated. Instead it\'s being attacked.</p>\n\n<p>Congress should pass H.R. 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and\nsend them to my desk right away.</p>\n\n<p>The country supports it.</p>\n\n<p>Congress should act.</p>\n\n<p>As we gather here tonight, the images of a violent mob assaulting this\nCapitol--desecrating our democracy--remain vivid in our minds.</p>\n\n<p>Lives were put at risk. Lives were lost. Extraordinary courage was\nsummoned.</p>\n\n<p>The insurrection was an existential crisis--a test of whether our\ndemocracy could survive.</p>\n\n<p>It did.</p>\n\n<p>But the struggle is far from over. The question of whether our democracy\n will long endure is both ancient and urgent.</p>\n\n<p>As old as our Republic. Still vital today.</p>\n\n<p>Can our democracy deliver on its promise that all of us -- created equal\nin the image of God -- have a chance to lead lives of dignity, respect,\nand possibility?</p>\n\n<p>Can our democracy deliver on the most pressing needs of our people?</p>\n\n<p>Can our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate and fears that have\npulled us apart?</p>\n\n<p>America\'s adversaries -- the autocrats of the world -- are betting it\ncan\'t.</p>\n\n<p>They believe we are too full of anger and division and rage.</p>\n\n<p>They look at the images of the mob that assaulted this Capitol as proof\nthat the sun is setting on American democracy.</p>\n\n<p>They are wrong. And we have to prove them wrong.</p>\n\n<p>We have to prove democracy still works.</p>\n\n<p>That our government still works -- and can deliver for the people.</p>\n\n<p>In our first 100 Days together, we have acted to restore the people\'s\nfaith in our democracy to deliver.</p>\n\n<p>We\'re vaccinating the nation. We\'re creating hundreds of thousands of\njobs. We\'re delivering real results people can see and feel in their own\nlives.</p>\n\n<p>Opening the doors of opportunity. Guaranteeing fairness and justice.</p>\n\n<p>That\'s the essence of America.</p>\n\n<p>That\'s democracy in action.</p>\n\n<p>Our Constitution opens with the words, "We the People".</p>\n\n<p>It\'s time we remembered that We the People are the government. You and\nI.</p>\n\n<p>Not some force in a distant capital. Not some powerful force we have no\ncontrol over.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s us. It\'s "We the people."</p>\n\n<p>In another era when our democracy was tested, Franklin Roosevelt\nreminded us--In America: we do our part.</p>\n\n<p>That\'s all I\'m asking. That we all do our part.</p>\n\n<p>And if we do, then we will meet the central challenge of the age by\nproving that democracy is durable and strong.</p>\n\n<p>The autocrats will not win the future.</p>\n\n<p>America will.</p>\n\n<p>The future will belong to America.</p>\n\n<p>I stand here tonight before you in a new and vital hour in the life of\nour democracy and our nation.</p>\n\n<p>And I can say with absolute confidence: I have never been more confident\nor more optimistic about America.</p>\n\n<p>We have stared into an abyss of insurrection and autocracy -- of\npandemic and pain -- and "We the People" did not flinch.</p>\n\n<p>At the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart and\nfail.</p>\n\n<p>We came together.</p>\n\n<p>United.</p>\n\n<p>With light and hope, we summoned new strength and new resolve.</p>\n\n<p>To position us to win the competition for the 21st Century.</p>\n\n<p>On our way forward to a Union more perfect. More prosperous. More just.</p>\n\n<p>As one people. One nation. One America.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s never been a good bet to bet against America.</p>\n\n<p>And it still isn\'t.</p>\n\n<p>We are the United States of America.</p>\n\n<p>There is nothing -- nothing -- beyond our capacity -- nothing we can\'t\ndo -- if we do it together.</p>\n\n<p>May God bless you all.</p>\n\n<p>May God protect our troops. \n</p>\n\t\t\t<div class="textNav"><a href="#top">^ Return to top</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>\n\t<div id="footer"><strong><em>State of the Union</em></strong> is a project\n\t\tby Brad Borevitz at <a href="http://www.onetwothree.net">onetwothree.net</a></div>\n</div>\n<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">\n</script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n_uacct = "UA-410742-1";\nurchinTracker();\n</script>\n</body>\n<!-- InstanceEnd -->\n</html>\n'
