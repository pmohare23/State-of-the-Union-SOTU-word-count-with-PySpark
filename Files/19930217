Clinton</h2>\n\t\t\t<h3>February 17, 1993</h3>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p>\nMr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the House and the Senate, distinguished\nAmericans here as visitors in this Chamber, as am I. It is nice to have a fresh\nexcuse for giving a long speech. [Laughter]</p>\n\n<p>When Presidents speak to Congress and the Nation from this podium, typically\nthey comment on the full range in challenges and opportunities that face the\nUnited States. But this is not an ordinary time, and for all the many tasks that\nrequire our attention, I believe tonight one calls on us to focus, to unite, and\nto act. And that is our economy. For more than anything else, our task tonight\nas Americans is to make our economy thrive again.</p>\n\n<p>Let me begin by saying that it has been too long, at least three decades, since\na President has come and challenged Americans to join him on a great national\njourney, not merely to consume the bounty of today but to invest for a much\ngreater one tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>Like individuals, nations must ultimately decide how they wish to conduct\nthemselves, how they wish to be thought of by those with whom they live, and\nlater, how they wish to be judged by history. Like every individual man and\nwoman, nations must decide whether they are prepared to rise to the occasions\nhistory presents them.</p>\n\n<p>We have always been a people of youthful energy and daring spirit. And at this\nhistoric moment, as communism has fallen, as freedom is spreading around the\nworld, as a global economy is taking shape before our eyes, Americans have\ncalled for change. And now it is up to those of us in this room to deliver for\nthem.</p>\n\n<p>Our Nation needs a new direction. Tonight I present to you a comprehensive plan\nto set our Nation on that new course. I believe we will find our new direction\nin the basic old values that brought us here over the last two centuries: a\ncommitment to opportunity, to individual responsibility, to community, to work,\nto family, and to faith. We must now break the habits of both political parties\nand say there can be no more something for nothing and admit frankly that we are\nall in this together.</p>\n\n<p>The conditions which brought us as a nation to this point are well-known: two\ndecades of low productivity, growth, and stagnant wages; persistent unemployment\nand underemployment; years of huge Government deficits and declining investment\nin our future; exploding health care costs and lack of coverage for millions of\nAmericans; legions of poor children; education and job training opportunities\ninadequate to the demands of this tough, global economy. For too long we have\ndrifted without a strong sense of purpose or responsibility or community.</p>\n\n<p>And our political system so often has seemed paralyzed by special interest\ngroups, by partisan bickering, and by the sheer complexity of our problems. I\nbelieve we can do better because we remain the greatest nation on Earth, the\nworld\'s strongest economy, the world\'s only military superpower. If we have the\nvision, the will, and the heart to make the changes we must, we can still enter\nthe 21st century with possibilities our parents could not even have imagined and\nenter it having secured the American dream for ourselves and for future\ngenerations.</p>\n\n<p>I well remember 12 years ago President Reagan stood at this very podium and told\nyou and the American people that if our national debt were stacked in\nthousand-dollar bills, the stack would reach 67 miles into space. Well, today\nthat stack would reach 267 miles. I tell you this not to assign blame for this\nproblem. There is plenty of blame to go around in both branches of the\nGovernment and both parties. The time has come for the blame to end. I did not\nseek this office to place blame. I come here tonight to accept responsibility,\nand I want you to accept responsibility with me. And if we do right by this\ncountry, I do not care who gets the credit for it.</p>\n\n<p>The plan I offer you has four fundamental components. First, it shifts our\nemphasis in public and private spending from consumption to investment,\ninitially by jumpstarting the economy in the short term and investing in our\npeople, their jobs, and their incomes over the long run. Second, it changes the\nrhetoric of the past into the actions of the present by honoring work and\nfamilies in every part of our public decision-making. Third, it substantially\nreduces the Federal deficit honestly and credibly by using in the beginning the\nmost conservative estimates of Government revenues, not, as the executive branch\nhas done so often in the past, using the most optimistic ones. And finally, it\nseeks to earn the trust of the American people by paying for these plans first\nwith cuts in Government waste and efficiency; second, with cuts, not gimmicks,\nin Government spending; and by fairness, for a change, in the way additional\nburdens are borne.</p>\n\n<p>Tonight I want to talk with you about what Government can do because I believe\nGovernment must do more. But let me say first that the real engine of economic\ngrowth in this country is the private sector, and second, that each of us must\nbe an engine of growth and change. The truth is that as Government creates more\nopportunity in this new and different time, we must also demand more\nresponsibility in turn.</p>\n\n<p>Our immediate priority must be to create jobs, create jobs now. Some people say,\n"Well, we\'re in a recovery, and we don\'t have to do that." Well, we all hope\nwe\'re in a recovery, but we\'re sure not creating new jobs. And there\'s no\nrecovery worth its salt that doesn\'t put the American people back to work.</p>\n\n<p>To create jobs and guarantee a strong recovery, I call on Congress to enact an\nimmediate package of jobs investments of over $30 billion to put people to work\nnow, to create a half a million jobs: jobs to rebuild our highways and airports,\nto renovate housing, to bring new life to rural communities, and spread hope and\nopportunity among our Nation\'s youth. Especially I want to emphasize, after the\nevents of last year in Los Angeles and the countless stories of despair in our\ncities and in our poor rural communities, this proposal will create almost\n700,000 new summer jobs for displaced, unemployed young people alone this\nsummer. And tonight I invite America\'s business leaders to join us in this\neffort so that together we can provide over one million summer jobs in cities\nand poor rural areas for our young people.</p>\n\n<p>Second, our plan looks beyond today\'s business cycle because our aspirations\nextend into the next century. The heart of this plan deals with the long term.\nIt is an investment program designed to increase public and private investment\nin areas critical to our economic future. And it has a deficit reduction program\nthat will increase the savings available for the private sector to invest, will\nlower interest rates, will decrease the percentage of the Federal budget claimed\nby interest payments, and decrease the risk of financial market disruptions that\ncould adversely affect our economy.</p>\n\n<p>Over the long run, all this will bring us a higher rate of economic growth,\nimproved productivity, more high-quality jobs, and an improved economic\ncompetitive position in the world. In order to accomplish both increased\ninvestment and deficit reduction, something no American Government has ever been\ncalled upon to do at the same time before, spending must be cut and taxes must\nbe raised.</p>\n\n<p>The spending cuts I recommend were carefully thought through in a way to\nminimize any adverse economic impact, to capture the peace dividend for\ninvestment purposes, and to switch the balance in the budget from consumption to\nmore investment. The tax increases and the spending cuts were both designed to\nassure that the cost of this historic program to face and deal with our problems\nwill be borne by those who could readily afford it the most. Our plan is\ndesigned, furthermore, and perhaps in some ways most importantly, to improve the\nhealth of American business through lower interest rates, more incentives to\ninvest, and better trained workers.</p>\n\n<p>Because small business has created such a high percentage of all the new jobs in\nour Nation over the last 10 or 15 years, our plan includes the boldest targeted\nincentives for small business in history. We propose a permanent investment tax\ncredit for the smallest firms in this country, with revenues of under $5\nmillion. That\'s about 90 percent of the firms in America, employing about 40\npercent of the work force but creating a big majority of the net new jobs for\nmore than a decade. And we propose new rewards for entrepreneurs who take new\nrisks. We propose to give small business access to all the new technologies of\nour time. And we propose to attack this credit crunch which has denied small\nbusiness the credit they need to flourish and prosper.</p>\n\n<p>With a new network of community development banks and $1 billion to make the\ndream of enterprise zones real, we propose to bring new hope and new jobs to\nstorefronts and factories from south Boston to south Texas to south central Los\nAngeles. This plan invests in our roads, our bridges, our transit systems, in\nhigh-speed railways and high-tech information systems. And it provides the most\nambitious environmental cleanup in partnership with State and local government\nof our time, to put people to work and to preserve the environment for our\nfuture.</p>\n\n<p>Standing as we are on the edge of a new century, we know that economic growth\ndepends as never before on opening up new markets overseas and expanding the\nvolume of world trade. And so, we will insist on fair trade rules in\ninternational markets as a part of a national economic strategy to expand trade,\nincluding the successful completion of the latest round of world trade talks and\nthe successful completion of a North American Free Trade Agreement with\nappropriate safeguards for our workers and for the environment.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time -- and I say this to you in both parties and across America\ntonight, all the people who are listening -- it is not enough to pass a budget or\neven to have a trade agreement. This world is changing so fast that we must have\naggressive, targeted attempts to create the high-wage jobs of the future. That\'s\nwhat all our competitors are doing. We must give special attention to those\ncritical industries that are going to explode in the 21st century but that are\nin trouble in America today, like aerospace. We must provide special assistance\nto areas and to workers displaced by cuts in the defense budget and by other\nunavoidable economic dislocations.</p>\n\n<p>And again I will say we must do this together. I pledge to you that I will do my\nbest to see that business and labor and Government work together for a change.</p>\n\n<p>But all of our efforts to strengthen the economy will fail -- let me say this\nagain; I feel so strongly about this -- all of our efforts to strengthen the\neconomy will fail unless we also take this year, not next year, not 5 years from\nnow but this year, bold steps to reform our health care system.</p>\n\n<p>In 1992, we spent 14 percent of our income on health care, more than 30 percent\nmore than any other country in the world, and yet we were the only advanced\nnation that did not provide a basic package of health care benefits to all of\nits citizens. Unless we change the present pattern, 50 percent of the growth in\nthe deficit between now and the year 2000 will be in health care costs. By the\nyear 2000 almost 20 percent of our income will be in health care. Our families\nwill never be secure, our businesses will never be strong, and our Government\nwill never again be fully solvent until we tackle the health care crisis. We\nmust do it this year.</p>\n\n<p>The combination of the rising cost of care and the lack of care and the fear of\nlosing care are endangering the security and the very lives of millions of our\npeople. And they are weakening our economy every day. Reducing health care costs\ncan liberate literally hundreds of billions of dollars for new investment in\ngrowth and jobs. Bringing health costs in line with inflation would do more for\nthe private sector in this country than any tax cut we could give and any\nspending program we could promote. Reforming health care over the long run is\ncritically essential to reducing not only our deficit but to expanding\ninvestment in America.</p>\n\n<p>Later this spring, after the First Lady and the many good people who are helping\nher all across the country complete their work, I will deliver to Congress a\ncomprehensive plan for health care reform that finally will bring costs under\ncontrol and provide security to all of our families, so that no one will be\ndenied the coverage they need but so that our economic future will not be\ncompromised either. We\'ll have to root out fraud and overcharges and make sure\nthat paperwork no longer chokes your doctor. We\'ll have to maintain the highest\nAmerican standards and the right to choose in a system that is the world\'s\nfinest for all those who can access it. But first we must make choices. We must\nchoose to give the American people the quality they demand and deserve with a\nsystem that will not bankrupt the country or further drive more Americans into\nagony.</p>\n\n<p>Let me further say that I want to work with all of you on this. I realize this\nis a complicated issue. But we must address it. And I believe if there is any\nchance that Republicans and Democrats who disagree on taxes and spending or\nanything else could agree on one thing, surely we can all look at these numbers\nand go home and tell our people the truth. We cannot continue these spending\npatterns in public or private dollars for health care for less and less and less\nevery year. We can do better. And I will work to do better.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most fundamental change the new direction I propose offers is its\nfocus on the future and its investment which I seek in our children. Each day we\ndelay really making a commitment to our children carries a dear cost. Half of\nthe 2-year-olds in this country today don\'t receive the immunizations they need\nagainst deadly diseases. Our plan will provide them for every eligible child.\nAnd we know now that we will save $10 later for every $1 we spend by eliminating\npreventable childhood diseases. That\'s a good investment no matter how you\nmeasure it.</p>\n\n<p>I recommend that the women, infants, and children\'s nutrition program be\nexpanded so that every expectant mother who needs the help gets it. We all know\nthat Head Start, a program that prepares children for school, is a success\nstory. We all know that it saves money. But today it just reaches barely over\none-third of all the eligible children. Under this plan, every eligible child\nwill be able to get a head start. This is not just the right thing to do; it is\nthe smart thing to do. For every dollar we invest today, we\'ll save $3 tomorrow.\nWe have to start thinking about tomorrow. I\'ve heard that somewhere before.\n[Laughter]</p>\n\n<p>We have to ask more in our schools of our students, our teachers, our\nprincipals, our parents. Yes, we must give them the resources they need to meet\nhigh standards, but we must also use the authority and the influence and the\nfunding of the Education Department to promote strategies that really work in\nlearning. Money alone is not enough. We have to do what really works to increase\nlearning in our schools.</p>\n\n<p>We have to recognize that all of our high school graduates need some further\neducation in order to be competitive in this global economy. So we have to\nestablish a partnership between businesses and education and the Government for\napprenticeship programs in every State in this country to give our people the\nskills they need. Lifelong learning must benefit not just young high school\ngraduates but workers, too, throughout their career. The average 18-year-old\ntoday will change jobs seven times in a lifetime. We have done a lot in this\ncountry on worker training in the last few years, but the system is too\nfractured. We must develop a unified, simplified, sensible, streamlined\nworker-training program so that workers receive the training they need\nregardless of why they lost their jobs or whether they simply need to learn\nsomething new to keep them. We have got to do better on this.</p>\n\n<p>And finally, I propose a program that got a great response from the American\npeople all across this country last year: a program of national service to make\ncollege loans available to all Americans and to challenge them at the same time\nto give something back to their country as teachers or police officers or\ncommunity service workers; to give them the option to pay the loans back, but at\ntax time so they can\'t beat the bill, but to encourage them instead to pay it\nback by making their country stronger and making their country better and giving\nus the benefit of their knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>A generation ago when President Kennedy proposed and the United States Congress\nembraced the Peace Corps, it defined the character of a whole generation of\nAmericans committed to serving people around the world. In this national service\nprogram, we will provide more than twice as many slots for people before they go\nto college to be in national service than ever served in the Peace Corps. This\nprogram could do for this generation of Members of Congress what the land grant\ncollege act did and what the GI bill did for former Congressmen. In the future,\nhistorians who got their education through the national service loan will look\nback on you and thank you for giving America a new lease on life, if you meet\nthis challenge.</p>\n\n<p>If we believe in jobs and we believe in learning, we must believe in rewarding\nwork. If we believe in restoring the values that make America special, we must\nbelieve that there is dignity in all work, and there must be dignity for all\nworkers. To those who care for our sick, who tend our children, who do our most\ndifficult and tiring jobs, the new direction I propose will make this solemn,\nsimple commitment: By expanding the refundable earned-income tax credit, we will\nmake history. We will reward the work of millions of working poor Americans by\nrealizing the principle that if you work 40 hours a week and you\'ve got a child\nin the house, you will no longer be in poverty.</p>\n\n<p>Later this year, we will offer a plan to end welfare as we know it. I have\nworked on this issue for the better part of a decade. And I know from personal\nconversations with many people that no one, no one wants to change the welfare\nsystem as badly as those who are trapped in it. I want to offer the people on\nwelfare the education, the training, the child care, the health care they need\nto get back on their feet, but say after 2 years they must get back to work,\ntoo, in private business if possible, in public service if necessary. We have to\nend welfare as a way of life and make it a path to independence and dignity.</p>\n\n<p>Our next great goal should be to strengthen our families. I compliment the\nCongress for passing the Family and Medical Leave Act as a good first step, but\nit is time to do more. This plan will give this country the toughest child\nsupport enforcement system it has ever had. It is time to demand that people\ntake responsibility for the children they bring in this world.</p>\n\n<p>And I ask you to help to protect our families against the violent crime which\nterrorizes our people and which tears our communities apart. We must pass a\ntough crime bill. I support not only the bill which didn\'t quite make it to the\nPresident\'s desk last year but also an initiative to put 100,000 more police\nofficers on the street, to provide boot camps for first-time nonviolent\noffenders for more space for the hardened criminals in jail. And I support an\ninitiative to do what we can to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. Let me\nsay this. I will make you this bargain: If you will pass the Brady bill, I\'ll\nsure sign it.</p>\n\n<p>Let me say now, we should move to the harder parts.</p>\n\n<p>I think it is clear to every American, including every Member of Congress of\nboth parties, that the confidence of the people who pay our bills in our\ninstitutions in Washington is not high. We must restore it. We must begin again\nto make Government work for ordinary taxpayers, not simply for organized\ninterest groups. And that beginning must start with real political reform. I am\nasking the United States Congress to pass a real campaign finance reform bill\nthis year. I ask you to increase the participation of the American people by\npassing the motor voter bill promptly. I ask you to deal with the undue\ninfluence of special interests by passing a bill to end the tax deduction for\nlobbying and to act quickly to require all the people who lobby you to register\nas lobbyists by passing the lobbying registration bill.</p>\n\n<p>Believe me, they were cheering that last section at home. I believe lobby reform\nand campaign finance reform are a sure path to increased popularity for\nRepublicans and Democrats alike because it says to the voters back home, "This\nis your House. This is your Senate. We\'re your hired hands, and every penny we\ndraw is your money."</p>\n\n<p>Next, to revolutionize Government we have to ensure that we live within our\nmeans, and that should start at the top and with the White House. In the last\nfew days I have announced a cut in the White House staff of 25 percent, saving\napproximately $10 million. I have ordered administrative cuts in budgets of\nagencies and departments. I have cut the Federal bureaucracy, or will over the\nnext 4 years, by approximately 100,000 positions, for a combined savings of $9\nbillion. It is time for Government to demonstrate, in the condition we\'re in,\nthat we can be as frugal as any household in America.</p>\n\n<p>And that\'s why I also want to congratulate the Congress. I noticed the\nannouncement of the leadership today that Congress is taking similar steps to\ncut its costs. I think that is important. I think it will send a very clear\nsignal to the American people.</p>\n\n<p>But if we really want to cut spending, we\'re going to have to do more, and some\nof it will be difficult. Tonight I call for an across-the-board freeze in\nFederal Government salaries for one year. And thereafter, during this 4-year\nperiod, I recommend that salaries rise at one point lower than the cost of\nliving allowance normally involved in Federal pay increases.</p>\n\n<p>Next, I recommend that we make 150 specific budget cuts, as you know, and that\nall those who say we should cut more be as specific as I have been. Finally, let\nme say to my friends on both sides of the aisle, it is not enough simply to cut\nGovernment; we have to rethink the whole way it works. When I became President I\nwas amazed at just the way the White House worked, in ways that added lots of\nmoney to what taxpayers had to pay, outmoded ways that didn\'t take maximum\nadvantage of technology and didn\'t do things that any business would have done\nyears ago to save taxpayers\' money.</p>\n\n<p>So I want to bring a new spirit of innovation into every Government Department.\nI want to push education reform, as I said, not just to spend more money but to\nreally improve learning. Some things work, and some things don\'t. We ought to be\nsubsidizing the things that work and discouraging the things that don\'t. I\'d\nlike to use that Superfund to clean up pollution for a change and not just pay\nlawyers.</p>\n\n<p>In the aftermath of all the difficulties with the savings and loans, we must use\nFederal bank regulators to protect the security and safety of our financial\ninstitutions, but they should not be used to continue the credit crunch and to\nstop people from making sensible loans.</p>\n\n<p>I\'d like for us to not only have welfare reform but to reexamine the whole focus\nof all of our programs that help people, to shift them from entitlement programs\nto empowerment programs. In the end we want people not to need us anymore. I\nthink that\'s important.</p>\n\n<p>But in the end we have to get back to the deficit. For years there\'s been a lot\nof talk about it but very few credible efforts to deal with it. And now I\nunderstand why, having dealt with the real numbers for 4 weeks. But I believe\nthis plan does; it tackles the budget deficit seriously and over the long term.\nIt puts in place one of the biggest deficit reductions and one of the biggest\nchanges in Federal priorities, from consumption to investment, in the history of\nthis country at the same time over the next 4 years.</p>\n\n<p>Let me say to all the people watching us tonight who will ask me these questions\nbeginning tomorrow as I go around the country and who\'ve asked it in the past:\nWe\'re not cutting the deficit just because experts say it\'s the thing to do or\nbecause it has some intrinsic merit. We have to cut the deficit because the more\nwe spend paying off the debt, the less tax dollars we have to invest in jobs and\neducation and the future of this country. And the more money we take out of the\npool of available savings, the harder it is for people in the private sector to\nborrow money at affordable interest rates for a college loan for their children,\nfor a home mortgage, or to start a new business.</p>\n\n<p>That\'s why we\'ve got to reduce the debt, because it is crowding out other\nactivities that we ought to be engaged in and that the American people ought to\nbe engaged in. We cut the deficit so that our children will be able to buy a\nhome, so that our companies can invest in the future and in retraining their\nworkers, so that our Government can make the kinds of investments we need to be\na stronger and smarter and safer nation.</p>\n\n<p>If we don\'t act now, you and I might not even recognize this Government 10 years\nfrom now. If we just stay with the same trends of the last 4 years, by the end\nof the decade the deficit will be $635 billion a year, almost 80 percent of our\ngross domestic product. And paying interest on that debt will be the costliest\nGovernment program of all. We\'ll still be the world\'s largest debtor. And when\nMembers of Congress come here, they\'ll be devoting over 20 cents on the dollar\nto interest payments, more than half of the budget to health care and to other\nentitlements. And you\'ll come here and deliberate and argue over 6 or 7 cents on\nthe dollar, no matter what America\'s problems are. We will not be able to have\nthe independence we need to chart the future that we must. And we\'ll be terribly\ndependent on foreign funds for a large portion of our investment.</p>\n\n<p>This budget plan, by contrast, will by 1997 cut $140 billion in that year alone\nfrom the deficit, a real spending cut, a real revenue increase, a real deficit\nreduction, using the independent numbers of the Congressional Budget Office.\n[Laughter] Well, you can laugh, my fellow Republicans, but I\'ll point out that\nthe Congressional Budget Office was normally more conservative in what was going\nto happen and closer to right than previous Presidents have been.</p>\n\n<p>I did this so that we could argue about priorities with the same set of numbers.\nI did this so that no one could say I was estimating my way out of this\ndifficulty. I did this because if we can agree together on the most prudent\nrevenues we\'re likely to get if the recovery stays and we do right things\neconomically, then it will turn out better for the American people than we say.\nIn the last 12 years, because there were differences over the revenue estimates,\nyou and I know that both parties were given greater elbow room for\nirresponsibility. This is tightening the rein on the Democrats as well as the\nRepublicans. Let\'s at least argue about the same set of numbers so the American\npeople will think we\'re shooting straight with them.</p>\n\n<p>As I said earlier, my recommendation makes more than 150 difficult reductions to\ncut the Federal spending by a total of $246 billion. We are eliminating programs\nthat are no longer needed, such as nuclear power research and development. We\'re\nslashing subsidies and canceling wasteful projects. But many of these programs\nwere justified in their time, and a lot of them are difficult for me to\nrecommend reductions in, some really tough ones for me personally. I recommend\nthat we reduce interest subsidies to the Rural Electric Administration. That\'s a\ndifficult thing for me to recommend. But I think that I cannot exempt the things\nthat exist in my State or in my experience, if I ask you to deal with things\nthat are difficult for you to deal with. We\'re going to have to have no sacred\ncows except the fundamental abiding interest of the American people.</p>\n\n<p>I have to say that we all know our Government has been just great at building\nprograms. The time has come to show the American people that we can limit them\ntoo; that we can not only start things, that we can actually stop things.</p>\n\n<p>About the defense budget, I raise a hope and a caution. As we restructure our\nmilitary forces to meet the new threats of the post-cold-war world, it is true\nthat we can responsibly reduce our defense budget. And we may all doubt what\nthat range of reductions is, but let me say that as long as I am President, I\nwill do everything I can to make sure that the men and women who serve under the\nAmerican flag will remain the best trained, the best prepared, the best equipped\nfighting force in the world. And every one of you should make that solemn\npledge. We still have responsibilities around the world. We are the world\'s only\nsuperpower. This is still a dangerous and uncertain time, and we owe it to the\npeople in uniform to make sure that we adequately provide for the national\ndefense and for their interests and needs. Backed by an effective national\ndefense and a stronger economy, our Nation will be prepared to lead a world\nchallenged as it is everywhere by ethnic conflict, by the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction, by the global democratic revolution, and by\nchallenges to the health of our global environment.</p>\n\n<p>I know this economic plan is ambitious, but I honestly believe it is necessary\nfor the continued greatness of the United States. And I think it is paid for\nfairly, first by cutting Government, then by asking the most of those who\nbenefited the most in the past, and by asking more Americans to contribute today\nso that all of us can prosper tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>For the wealthiest, those earning more than $180,000 per year, I ask you all who\nare listening tonight to support a raise in the top rate for Federal income\ntaxes from 31 to 36 percent. We recommend a 10 percent surtax on incomes over\n$250,000 a year, and we recommend closing some loopholes that let some people\nget away without paying any tax at all.</p>\n\n<p>For businesses with taxable incomes in excess of $10 million, we recommend a\nraise in the corporate tax rate, also to 36 percent, as well as a cut in the\ndeduction for business entertainment expenses. Our plan seeks to attack tax\nsubsidies that actually reward companies more for shutting their operations down\nhere and moving them overseas than for staying here and reinvesting in America.\nI say that as someone who believes that American companies should be free to\ninvest around the world and as a former Governor who actively sought investment\nof foreign companies in my State. But the Tax Code should not express a\npreference to American companies for moving somewhere else, and it does in\nparticular cases today.</p>\n\n<p>We will seek to ensure that, through effective tax enforcement, foreign\ncorporations who do make money in America simply pay the same taxes that\nAmerican companies make on the same income.</p>\n\n<p>To middle class Americans who have paid a great deal for the last 12 years and\nfrom whom I ask a contribution tonight, I will say again as I did on Monday\nnight: You\'re not going alone any more, you\'re certainly not going first, and\nyou\'re not going to pay more for less as you have too often in the past. I want\nto emphasize the facts about this plan: 98.8 percent of America\'s families will\nhave no increase in their income tax rates, only 1.2 percent at the top.</p>\n\n<p>Let me be clear: There will also be no new cuts in benefits for Medicare. As we\nmove toward the 4th year, with the explosion in health care costs, as I said,\nprojected to account for 50 percent of the growth of the deficit between now and\nthe year 2000, there must be planned cuts in payments to providers, to doctors,\nto hospitals, to labs, as a way of controlling health care costs. But I see\nthese only as a stopgap until we can reform the entire health care system. If\nyou\'ll help me do that, we can be fair to the providers and to the consumers of\nhealth care. Let me repeat this, because I know it matters to a lot of you on\nboth sides of the aisle. This plan does not make a recommendation for new cuts\nin Medicare benefits for any beneficiary.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, the only change we are making in Social Security is one that has\nalready been publicized. The plan does ask older Americans with higher incomes,\nwho do not rely solely on Social Security to get by, to contribute more. This\nplan will not affect the 80 percent of Social Security recipients who do not pay\ntaxes on Social Security now. Those who do not pay tax on Social Security now\nwill not be affected by this plan.</p>\n\n<p>Our plan does include a broad-based tax on energy, and I want to tell you why I\nselected this and why I think it\'s a good idea. I recommend that we adopt a Btu\ntax on the heat content of energy as the best way to provide us with revenue to\nlower the deficit because it also combats pollution, promotes energy efficiency,\npromotes the independence, economically, of this country as well as helping to\nreduce the debt, and because it does not discriminate against any area. Unlike a\ncarbon tax, that\'s not too hard on the coal States; unlike a gas tax, that\'s not\ntoo tough on people who drive a long way to work; unlike an ad valorem tax, it\ndoesn\'t increase just when the price of an energy source goes up. And it is\nenvironmentally responsible. It will help us in the future as well as in the\npresent with the deficit.</p>\n\n<p>Taken together, these measures will cost an American family with an income of\nabout $40,000 a year less than $17 a month. It will cost American families with\nincomes under $30,000 nothing because of other programs we propose, principally\nthose raising the earned-income tax credit.</p>\n\n<p>Because of our publicly stated determination to reduce the deficit, if we do\nthese things, we will see the continuation of what\'s happened just since the\nelection. Just since the election, since the Secretary of the Treasury, the\nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget, and others who have begun to\nspeak out publicly in favor of a tough deficit reduction plan, interest rates\nhave continued to fall long-term. That means that for the middle class who will\npay something more each month, if they had any credit needs or demands, their\nincreased energy costs will be more than offset by lower interest costs for\nmortgages, consumer loans, credit cards. This can be a wise investment for them\nand their country now.</p>\n\n<p>I would also point out what the American people already know, and that is,\nbecause we\'re a big, vast country where we drive long distances, we have\nmaintained far lower burdens on energy than any other advanced country. We will\nstill have far lower burdens on energy than any other advanced country. And\nthese will be spread fairly, with real attempts to make sure that no cost is\nimposed on families with incomes under $30,000 and that the costs are very\nmodest until you get into the higher income groups where the income taxes\ntrigger in.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I ask all of you to consider this: Whatever you think of the tax program,\nwhatever you think of the spending cuts, consider the cost of not changing.\nRemember the numbers that you all know. If we just keep on doing what we\'re\ndoing, by the end of the decade we\'ll have a $650-billion-a-year deficit. If we\njust keep on doing what we\'re doing, by the end of the decade 20 percent of our\nnational income will go to health care every year, twice as much as any other\ncountry on the face of the globe. If we just keep on doing what we\'re doing,\nover 20 cents on the dollar will have to go to service the debt.</p>\n\n<p>Unless we have the courage now to start building our future and stop borrowing\nfrom it, we\'re condemning ourselves to years of stagnation interrupted by\noccasional recessions, to slow growth in jobs, to no more growth in income, to\nmore debt, to more disappointment. Worse, unless we change, unless we increase\ninvestment and reduce the debt to raise productivity so that we can generate\nboth jobs and incomes, we will be condemning our children and our children\'s\nchildren to a lesser life than we enjoyed. Once Americans looked forward to\ndoubling their living standards every 25 years. At present productivity rates,\nit will take 100 years to double living standards, until our grandchildren\'s\ngrandchildren are born. I say that is too long to wait.</p>\n\n<p>Tonight the American people know we have to change. But they\'re also likely to\nask me tomorrow and all of you for the weeks and months ahead whether we have\nthe fortitude to make the changes happen in the right way. They know that as\nsoon as I leave this Chamber and you go home, various interest groups will be\nout in force lobbying against this or that piece of this plan, and that the\nforces of conventional wisdom will offer a thousand reasons why we well ought to\ndo this but we just can\'t do it.</p>\n\n<p>Our people will be watching and wondering, not to see whether you disagree with\nme on a particular issue but just to see whether this is going to be business as\nusual or a real new day, whether we\'re all going to conduct ourselves as if we\nknow we\'re working for them. We must scale the walls of the people\'s\nscepticisms, not with our words but with our deeds. After so many years of\ngridlock and indecision, after so many hopeful beginnings and so few promising\nresults, the American people are going to be harsh in their judgments of all of\nus if we fail to seize this moment.</p>\n\n<p>This economic plan can\'t please everybody. If the package is picked apart, there\nwill be something that will anger each of us, won\'t please anybody. But if it is\ntaken as a whole, it will help all of us. So I ask you all to begin by resisting\nthe temptation to focus only on a particular spending cut you don\'t like or some\nparticular investment that wasn\'t made. And nobody likes the tax increases, but\nlet\'s just face facts. For 20 years, through administrations of both parties,\nincomes have stalled and debt has exploded and productivity has not grown as it\nshould. We cannot deny the reality of our condition. We have got to play the\nhand we were dealt and play it as best we can.</p>\n\n<p>My fellow Americans, the test of this plan cannot be "what is in it for me." It\nhas got to be "what is in it for us." If we work hard and if we work together,\nif we rededicate ourselves to creating jobs, to rewarding work, to strengthening\nour families, to reinventing our Government, we can lift our country\'s fortunes\nagain.</p>\n\n<p>Tonight I ask everyone in this Chamber and every American to look simply into\nyour heart, to spark your own hopes, to fire your own imagination. There is so\nmuch good, so much possibility, so much excitement in this country now that if\nwe act boldly and honestly, as leaders should, our legacy will be one of\nprosperity and progress. This must be America\'s new direction. Let us summon the\ncourage to seize it.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you. God bless America.\n</p>\n\t\t\t<div class="textNav"><a href="#top">^ Return to top</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>\n\t<div id="footer"><strong><em>State of the Union</em></strong> is a project\n\t\tby Brad Borevitz at <a href="http://www.onetwothree.net">onetwothree.net</a></div>\n</div>\n<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">\n</script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n_uacct = "UA-410742-1";\nurchinTracker();\n</script>\n</body>\n<!-- InstanceEnd -->\n</html>\n'
