The general health of the country has been excellent, our harvests\nhave been unusually plentiful, and prosperity smiles throughout the land.\nIndeed, notwithstanding our demerits, we have much reason to believe from\nthe past events in our history that we have enjoyed the special protection\nof Divine Providence ever since our origin as a nation. We have been\nexposed to many threatening and alarming difficulties in our progress, but\non each successive occasion the impending cloud has been dissipated at the\nmoment it appeared ready to burst upon our head, and the danger to our\ninstitutions has passed away. May we ever be under the divine guidance and\nprotection. Whilst it is the duty of the President "from time to time to\ngive to Congress information of the state of the Union," I shall not refer\nin detail to the recent sad and bloody occurrences at Harpers Ferry. Still,\nit is proper to observe that these events, however bad and cruel in\nthemselves, derive their chief importance from the apprehension that they\nare but symptoms of an incurable disease in the public mind, which may\nbreak out in still more dangerous outrages and terminate at last in an open\nwar by the North to abolish slavery in the South. Whilst for myself I\nentertain no such apprehension, they ought to afford a solemn warning to us\nall to beware of the approach of danger. Our Union is a stake of such\ninestimable value as to demand our constant and watchful vigilance for its\npreservation. In this view, let me implore my countrymen, North and South,\nto cultivate the ancient feelings of mutual forbearance and good will\ntoward each other and strive to allay the demon spirit of sectional hatred\nand strife now alive in the land. This advice proceeds from the heart of an\nold public functionary whose service commenced in the last generation,\namong the wise and conservative statesmen of that day, now nearly all\npassed away, and whose first and dearest earthly wish is to leave his\ncountry tranquil, prosperous, united, and powerful.</p>\n\n<p>We ought to reflect that in this age, and especially in this country, there\nis an incessant flux and reflux of public opinion. Questions which in their\nday assumed a most threatening aspect have now nearly gone from the memory\nof men. They are "volcanoes burnt out, and on the lava and ashes and\nsqualid scoria of old eruptions grow the peaceful olive, the cheering vine,\nand the sustaining corn." Such, in my opinion, will prove to be the fate of\nthe present sectional excitement should those who wisely seek to apply the\nremedy continue always to confine their efforts within the pale of the\nConstitution. If this course be pursued, the existing agitation on the\nsubject of domestic slavery, like everything human, will have its day and\ngive place to other and less threatening controversies. Public opinion in\nthis country is all-powerful, and when it reaches a dangerous excess upon\nany question the good sense of the people will furnish the corrective and\nbring it back within safe limits. Still, to hasten this auspicious result\nat the present crisis we ought to remember that every rational creature\nmust be presumed to intend the natural consequences of his own teachings.\nThose who announce abstract doctrines subversive of the Constitution and\nthe Union must not be surprised should their heated partisans advance one\nstep further and attempt by violence to carry these doctrines into\npractical effect. In this view of the subject, it ought never to be\nforgotten that however great may have been the political advantages\nresulting from the Union to every portion of our common country, these\nwould all prove to be as nothing should the time ever arrive when they can\nnot be enjoyed without serious danger to the personal safety of the people\nof fifteen members of the Confederacy. If the peace of the domestic\nfireside throughout these States should ever be invaded, if the mothers of\nfamilies within this extensive region should not be able to retire to rest\nat night without suffering dreadful apprehensions of what may be their own\nfate and that of their children before the morning, it would be vain to\nrecount to such a people the political benefits which result to them from\nthe Union. Self-preservation is the first instinct of nature, and therefore\nany state of society in which the sword is all the time suspended over the\nheads of the people must at last become intolerable. But I indulge in no\nsuch gloomy forebodings. On the contrary, I firmly believe that the events\nat Harpers Ferry, by causing the people to pause and reflect upon the\npossible peril to their cherished institutions, will be the means under\nProvidence of allaying the existing excitement and preventing further\noutbreaks of a similar character. They will resolve that the Constitution\nand the Union shall not be endangered by rash counsels, knowing that should\n"the silver cord be loosed or the golden bowl be broken at the fountain"\nhuman power could never reunite the scattered and hostile fragments.</p>\n\n<p>I cordially congratulate you upon the final settlement by the Supreme Court\nof the United States of the question of slavery in the Territories, which\nhad presented an aspect so truly formidable at the commencement of my\nAdministration. The right has been established of every citizen to take his\nproperty of any kind, including slaves, into the common Territories\nbelonging equally to all the States of the Confederacy, and to have it\nprotected there under the Federal Constitution. Neither Congress nor a\nTerritorial legislature nor any human power has any authority to annul or\nimpair this vested right. The supreme judicial tribunal of the country,\nwhich is a coordinate branch of the Government, has sanctioned and affirmed\nthese principles of constitutional law, so manifestly just in themselves\nand so well calculated to promote peace and harmony among the States. It is\na striking proof of the sense of justice which is inherent in our people\nthat the property in slaves has never been disturbed, to my knowledge, in\nany of the Territories. Even throughout the late troubles in Kansas there\nhas not been any attempt, as I am credibly informed, to interfere in a\nsingle instance with the right of the master. Had any such attempt been\nmade, the judiciary would doubtless have afforded an adequate remedy.\nShould they fail to do this hereafter, it will then be time enough to\nstrengthen their hands by further legislation. Had it been decided that\neither Congress or the Territorial legislature possess the power to annul\nor impair the right to property in slaves, the evil would be intolerable.\nIn the latter event there would be a struggle for a majority of the members\nof the legislature at each successive election, and the sacred rights of\nproperty held under the Federal Constitution would depend for the time\nbeing on the result. The agitation would thus be rendered incessant whilst\nthe Territorial condition remained, and its baneful influence would keep\nalive a dangerous excitement among the people of the several States.</p>\n\n<p>Thus has the status of a Territory during the intermediate period from its\nfirst settlement until it shall become a State been irrevocably fixed by\nthe final decision of the Supreme Court. Fortunate has this been for the\nprosperity of the Territories, as well as the tranquillity of the States.\nNow emigrants from the North and the South, the East and the West, will\nmeet in the Territories on a common platform, having brought with them that\nspecies of property best adapted, in their own opinion, to promote their\nwelfare. From natural causes the slavery question will in each case soon\nvirtually settle itself, and before the Territory is prepared for admission\nas a State into the Union this decision, one way or the other, will have\nbeen a foregone conclusion. Meanwhile the settlement of the new Territory\nwill proceed without serious interruption, and its progress and prosperity\nwill not be endangered or retarded by violent political struggles.</p>\n\n<p>When in the progress of events the inhabitants of any Territory shall have\nreached the number required to form a State, they will then proceed in a\nregular manner and in the exercise of the rights of popular sovereignty to\nform a constitution preparatory to admission into the Union. After this has\nbeen done, to employ the language of the Kansas and Nebraska act, they\n"shall be received into the Union with or without slavery, as their\nconstitution may prescribe at the time of their admission." This sound\nprinciple has happily been recognized in some form or other by an almost\nunanimous vote of both Houses of the last Congress.</p>\n\n<p>All lawful means at my command have been employed, and shall continue to be\nemployed, to execute the laws against the African slave trade. After a most\ncareful and rigorous examination of our coasts and a thorough investigation\nof the subject, we have not been able to discover that any slaves have been\nimported into the United States except the cargo by the Wanderer, numbering\nbetween three and four hundred. Those engaged in this unlawful enterprise\nhave been rigorously prosecuted, but not with as much success as their\ncrimes have deserved. A number of them are still under prosecution.</p>\n\n<p>Our history proves that the fathers of the Republic, in advance of all\nother nations, condemned the African slave trade. It was, notwithstanding,\ndeemed expedient by the framers of the Constitution to deprive Congress of\nthe power to prohibit "the migration or importation of such persons as any\nof the States now existing shall think proper to admit" "prior to the year\n1808." It will be seen that this restriction on the power of Congress was\nconfined to such States only as might think proper to admit the importation\nof slaves. It did not extend to other States or to the trade carried on\nabroad. Accordingly, we find that so early as the 22d March, 1794, Congress\npassed an act imposing severe penalties and punishments upon citizens and\nresidents of the United States who should engage in this trade between\nforeign nations. The provisions of this act were extended and enforced by\nthe act of 10th May, 1800.</p>\n\n<p>Again, the States themselves had a clear right to waive the constitutional\nprivilege intended for their benefit, and to prohibit by their own laws\nthis trade at any time they thought proper previous to 1808. Several of\nthem exercised this right before that period, and among them some\ncontaining the greatest number of slaves. This gave to Congress the\nimmediate power to act in regard to all such States, because they\nthemselves had removed the constitutional barrier. Congress accordingly\npassed an act on 28th February, 1803, "to prevent the importation of\ncertain persons into certain States where by the laws thereof their\nadmission is prohibited." In this manner the importation of African slaves\ninto the United States was to a great extent prohibited some years in\nadvance of 1808.</p>\n\n<p>As the year 1808 approached Congress determined not to suffer this trade to\nexist even for a single day after they had the power to abolish it. On the\n2d of March, 1807, they passed an act, to take effect "from and after the\n1st day of January, 1808," prohibiting the importation of African slaves\ninto the United States. This was followed by subsequent acts of a similar\ncharacter, to which I need not specially refer. Such were the principles\nand such the practice of our ancestors more than fifty years ago in regard\nto the African slave trade. It did not occur to the revered patriots who\nhad been delegates to the Convention, and afterwards became members of\nCongress, that in passing these laws they had violated the Constitution\nwhich they had framed with so much care and deliberation. They supposed\nthat to prohibit Congress in express terms from exercising a specified\npower before an appointed day necessarily involved the right to exercise\nthis power after that day had arrived.</p>\n\n<p>If this were not the case, the framers of the Constitution had expended\nmuch labor in vain. Had they imagined that Congress would possess no power\nto prohibit the trade either before or after 1808, they would not have\ntaken so much care to protect the States against the exercise of this power\nbefore that period. Nay, more, they would not have attached such vast\nimportance to this provision as to have excluded it from the possibility of\nfuture repeal or amendment, to which other portions of the Constitution\nwere exposed. It would, then, have been wholly unnecessary to ingraft on\nthe fifth article of the Constitution, prescribing the mode of its own\nfuture amendment, the proviso "that no amendment which may be made prior to\nthe year 1808 shall in any manner affect" the provision in the Constitution\nsecuring to the States the right to admit the importation of African slaves\nprevious to that period. According to the adverse construction, the clause\nitself, on which so much care and discussion had been employed by the\nmembers of the Convention, was an absolute nullity from the beginning, and\nall that has since been done under it a mere usurpation.</p>\n\n<p>It was well and wise to confer this power on Congress, because had it been\nleft to the States its efficient exercise would have been impossible. In\nthat event any one State could have effectually continued the trade, not\nonly for itself, but for all the other slave States, though never so much\nagainst their will. And why? Because African slaves, when once brought\nwithin the limits of any one State in accordance with its laws, can not\npractically be excluded from any State where slavery exists. And even if\nall the States had separately passed laws prohibiting the importation of\nslaves, these laws would have failed of effect for want of a naval force to\ncapture the slavers and to guard the coast. Such a force no State can\nemploy in time of peace without the consent of Congress.</p>\n\n<p>These acts of Congress, it is believed, have, with very rare and\ninsignificant exceptions, accomplished their purpose. For a period of more\nthan half a century there has been no perceptible addition to the number of\nour domestic slaves. During this period their advancement in civilization\nhas far surpassed that of any other portion of the African race. The light\nand the blessings of Christianity have been extended to them, and both\ntheir moral and physical condition has been greatly improved.</p>\n\n<p>Reopen the trade and it would be difficult to determine whether the effect\nwould be more deleterious on the interests of the master or on those of the\nnative-born slave. Of the evils to the master, the one most to be dreaded\nwould be the introduction of wild, heathen, and ignorant barbarians among\nthe sober, orderly, and quiet slaves whose ancestors have been on the soil\nfor several generations. This might tend to barbarize, demoralize, and\nexasperate the whole mass and produce most deplorable consequences.</p>\n\n<p>The effect upon the existing slave would, if possible, be still more\ndeplorable. At present he is treated with kindness and humanity. He is well\nfed, well clothed, and not overworked. His condition is incomparably better\nthan that of the coolies which modern nations of high civilization have\nemployed as a substitute for African slaves. Both the philanthropy and the\nself-interest of the master have combined to produce this humane result.\nBut let this trade be reopened and what will be the effect? The same to a\nconsiderable extent as on a neighboring island, the only spot now on earth\nwhere the African slave trade is openly tolerated, and this in defiance of\nsolemn treaties with a power abundantly able at any moment to enforce their\nexecution. There the master, intent upon present gain, extorts from the\nslave as much labor as his physical powers are capable of enduring, knowing\nthat when death comes to his relief his place can be supplied at a price\nreduced to the lowest point by the competition of rival African slave\ntraders. Should this ever be the case in our country, which I do not deem\npossible, the present useful character of the domestic institution, wherein\nthose too old and too young to work are provided for with care and humanity\nand those capable of labor are not overtasked, would undergo an unfortunate\nchange. The feeling of reciprocal dependence and attachment which now\nexists between master and slave would be converted into mutual distrust and\nhostility.</p>\n\n<p>But we are obliged as a Christian and moral nation to consider what would\nbe the effect upon unhappy Africa itself if we should reopen the slave\ntrade. This would give the trade an impulse and extension which it has\nnever had, even in its palmiest days. The numerous victims required to\nsupply it would convert the whole slave coast into a perfect pandemonium,\nfor which this country would be held responsible in the eyes both of God\nand man. Its petty tribes would then be constantly engaged in predatory\nwars against each other for the purpose of seizing slaves to supply the\nAmerican market. All hopes of African civilization would thus be ended.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, when a market for African slaves shall no longer be\nfurnished in Cuba, and thus all the world be closed against this trade, we\nmay then indulge a reasonable hope for the gradual improvement of Africa.\nThe chief motive of war among the tribes will cease whenever there is no\nlonger any demand for slaves. The resources of that fertile but miserable\ncountry might then be developed by the hand of industry and afford subjects\nfor legitimate foreign and domestic commerce. In this manner Christianity\nand civilization may gradually penetrate the existing gloom.</p>\n\n<p>The wisdom of the course pursued by this Government toward China has been\nvindicated by the event. Whilst we sustained a neutral position in the war\nwaged by Great Britain and France against the Chinese Empire, our late\nminister, in obedience to his instructions, judiciously cooperated with the\nministers of these powers in all peaceful measures to secure by treaty the\njust concessions demanded by the interests of foreign commerce. The result\nis that satisfactory treaties have been concluded with China by the\nrespective ministers of the United States, Great Britain, France, and\nRussia. Our "treaty, or general convention, of peace, amity, and commerce"\nwith that Empire was concluded at Tien-tsin on the 18th June, 1858, and was\nratified by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the\nSenate, on the 21st December following. On the 15th December, 1858, John E.\nWard, a distinguished citizen of Georgia, was duly commissioned as envoy\nextraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to China.</p>\n\n<p>He left the United States for the place of his destination on the 5th of\nFebruary, 1859, bearing with him the ratified copy of this treaty, and\narrived at Shanghai on the 28th May. From thence he proceeded to Peking on\nthe 16th June, but did not arrive in that city until the 27th July.\nAccording to the terms of the treaty, the ratifications were to be\nexchanged on or before the 18th June, 1859. This was rendered impossible by\nreasons and events beyond his control, not necessary to detail; but still\nit is due to the Chinese authorities at Shanghai to state that they always\nassured him no advantage should be taken of the delay, and this pledge has\nbeen faithfully redeemed.</p>\n\n<p>On the arrival of Mr. Ward at Peking he requested an audience of the\nEmperor to present his letter of credence. This he did not obtain, in\nconsequence of his very proper refusal to submit to the humiliating\nceremonies required by the etiquette of this strange people in approaching\ntheir sovereign. Nevertheless, the interviews on this question were\nconducted in the most friendly spirit and with all due regard to his\npersonal feelings and the honor of his country. When a presentation to His\nMajesty was found to be impossible, the letter of credence from the\nPresident was received with peculiar honors by Kweiliang, "the Emperor\'s\nprime minister and the second man in the Empire to the Emperor himself."\nThe ratifications of the treaty were afterwards, on the 16th of August,\nexchanged in proper form at Peit-sang. As the exchange did not take place\nuntil after the day prescribed by the treaty, it is deemed proper before\nits publication again to submit it to the Senate. It is but simple justice\nto the Chinese authorities to observe that throughout the whole transaction\nthey appear to have acted in good faith and in a friendly spirit toward the\nUnited States. It is true this has been done after their own peculiar\nfashion; but we ought to regard with a lenient eye the ancient customs of\nan empire dating back for thousands of years, so far as this may be\nconsistent with our own national honor. The conduct of our minister on the\noccasion has received my entire approbation.</p>\n\n<p>In order to carry out the spirit of this treaty and to give it full effect\nit became necessary to conclude two supplemental conventions, the one for\nthe adjustment and satisfaction of the claims of our citizens and the other\nto fix the tariff on imports and exports and to regulate the transit duties\nand trade of our merchants with China. This duty was satisfactorily\nperformed by our late minister. These conventions bear date at Shanghai on\nthe 8th November, 1858. Having been considered in the light of binding\nagreements subsidiary to the principal treaty, and to be carried into\nexecution without delay, they do not provide for any formal ratification or\nexchange of ratifications by the contracting parties. This was not deemed\nnecessary by the Chinese, who are already proceeding in good faith to\nsatisfy the claims of our citizens and, it is hoped, to carry out the other\nprovisions of the conventions. Still, I thought it was proper to submit\nthem to the Senate by which they were ratified on the 3d of March, 1859.\nThe ratified copies, however, did not reach Shanghai until after the\ndeparture of our minister to Peking, and these conventions could not,\ntherefore, be exchanged at the same time with the principal treaty. No\ndoubt is entertained that they will be ratified and exchanged by the\nChinese Government should this be thought advisable; but under the\ncircumstances presented I shall consider them binding engagements from\ntheir date on both parties, and cause them to be published as such for the\ninformation and guidance of our merchants trading with the Chinese Empire.</p>\n\n<p>It affords me much satisfaction to inform you that all our difficulties\nwith the Republic of Paraguay have been satisfactorily adjusted. It happily\ndid not become necessary to employ the force for this purpose which\nCongress had placed at my command under the joint resolution of 2d June,\n1858. On the contrary, the President of that Republic, in a friendly\nspirit, acceded promptly to the just and reasonable demands of the\nGovernment of the United States. Our commissioner arrived at Assumption,\nthe capital of the Republic, on the 25th of January, 1859, and left it on\nthe 17th of February, having in three weeks ably and successfully\naccomplished all the objects of his mission. The treaties which he has\nconcluded will be immediately submitted to the Senate.</p>\n\n<p>In the view that the employment of other than peaceful means might become\nnecessary to obtain "just satisfaction" from Paraguay, a strong naval force\nwas concentrated in the waters of the La Plata to await contingencies\nwhilst our commissioner ascended the rivers to Assumption. The Navy\nDepartment is entitled to great credit for the promptness, efficiency, and\neconomy with which this expedition was fitted out and conducted. It\nconsisted of 19 armed vessels, great and small, carrying 200 guns and 2,500\nmen, all under the command of the veteran and gallant Shubrick. The entire\nexpenses of the expedition have been defrayed out of the ordinary\nappropriations for the naval service, except the sum of $289,000, applied\nto the purchase of seven of the steamers constituting a part of it, under\nthe authority of the naval appropriation act of the 3d March last. It is\nbelieved that these steamers are worth more than their cost, and they are\nall now usefully and actively employed in the naval service.</p>\n\n<p>The appearance of so large a force, fitted out in such a prompt manner, in\nthe far-distant waters of the La Plata, and the admirable conduct of the\nofficers and men employed in it, have had a happy effect in favor of our\ncountry throughout all that remote portion of the world. Our relations with\nthe great Empires of France and Russia, as well as with all other\ngovernments on the continent of Europe, unless we may except that of Spain,\nhappily continue to be of the most friendly character. In my last annual\nmessage I presented a statement of the unsatisfactory condition of our\nrelations with Spain, and I regret to say that this has not materially\nimproved.</p>\n\n<p>Without special reference to other claims, even the "Cuban claims," the\npayment of which has been ably urged by our ministers, and in which more\nthan a hundred of our citizens are directly interested, remain unsatisfied,\nnotwithstanding both their justice and their amount ($128,635.54) had been\nrecognized and ascertained by the Spanish Government itself.</p>\n\n<p>I again recommend that an appropriation be made "to be paid to the Spanish\nGovernment for the purpose of distribution among the claimants in the\nAmistad case." In common with two of my predecessors, I entertain no doubt\nthat this is required by our treaty with Spain of the 27th October, 1795.\nThe failure to discharge this obligation has been employed by the cabinet\nof Madrid as a reason against the settlement of our claims.</p>\n\n<p>I need not repeat the arguments which I urged in my last annual message in\nfavor of the acquisition of Cuba by fair purchase. My opinions on that\nmeasure remain unchanged. I therefore again invite the serious attention of\nCongress to this important subject. Without a recognition of this policy on\ntheir part it will be almost impossible to institute negotiations with any\nreasonable prospect of success. Until a recent period there was good reason\nto believe that I should be able to announce to you on the present occasion\nthat our difficulties with Great Britain arising out of the Clayton and\nBulwer treaty had been finally adjusted in a manner alike honorable and\nsatisfactory to both parties. From causes, however, which the British\nGovernment had not anticipated, they have not yet completed treaty\narrangements with the Republics of Honduras and Nicaragua, in pursuance of\nthe understanding between the two Governments. It is, nevertheless,\nconfidently expected that this good work will ere long be accomplished.</p>\n\n<p>Whilst indulging the hope that no other subject remained which could\ndisturb the good understanding between the two countries, the question\narising out of the adverse claims of the parties to the island of San Juan,\nunder the Oregon treaty of the 15th June, 1846, suddenly assumed a\nthreatening prominence. In order to prevent unfortunate collisions on that\nremote frontier, the late Secretary of State, on the 17th July, 1855,\naddressed a note to Mr. Crampton, then British minister at Washington,\ncommunicating to him a copy of the instructions which he (Mr. Marcy) had\ngiven on the 14th July to Governor Stevens, of Washington Territory, having\na special reference to an "apprehended conflict between our citizens and\nthe British subjects on the island of San Juan." To prevent this the\ngovernor was instructed "that the officers of the Territory should abstain\nfrom all acts on the disputed grounds which are calculated to provoke any\nconflicts, so far as it can be done without implying the concession to the\nauthorities of Great Britain of an exclusive right over the premises. The\ntitle ought to be settled before either party should attempt to exclude the\nother by force or exercise complete and exclusive sovereign rights within\nthe fairly disputed limits." In acknowledging the receipt on the next day\nof Mr. Marcy\'s note the British minister expressed his entire concurrence\n"in the propriety of the course recommended to the governor of Washington\nTerritory by your [Mr. Marcy\'s] instructions to that officer," and stating\nthat he had "lost no time in transmitting a copy of that document to the\nGovernor-General of British North America" and had "earnestly recommended\nto His Excellency to take such measures as to him may appear best\ncalculated to secure on the part of the British local authorities and the\ninhabitants of the neighborhood of the line in question the exercise of the\nsame spirit of forbearance which is inculcated by you [Mr. Marcy] on the\nauthorities and citizens of the United States."</p>\n\n<p>Thus matters remained upon the faith of this arrangement until the 9th July\nlast, when General Harney paid a visit to the island. He found upon it\ntwenty-five American residents with their families, and also an\nestablishment of the Hudsons Bay Company for the purpose of raising sheep.\nA short time before his arrival one of these residents had shot an animal\nbelonging to the company whilst trespassing upon his premises, for which,\nhowever, he offered to pay twice its value, but that was refused. Soon\nafter "the chief factor of the company at Victoria, Mr. Dalles, son-in-law\nof Governor Douglas, came to the island in the British sloop of war\nSatellite and threatened to take this American [Mr. Cutler] by force to\nVictoria to answer for the trespass he had committed. The American seized\nhis rifle and told Mr. Dalles if any such attempt was made he would kill\nhim upon the spot. The affair then ended."</p>\n\n<p>Under these circumstances the American settlers presented a petition to the\nGeneral "through the United States inspector of customs, Mr. Hubbs, to\nplace a force upon the island to protect them from the Indians as well as\nthe oppressive interference of the authorities of the Hudsons Bay Company\nat Victoria with their rights as American citizens." The General\nimmediately responded to this petition, and ordered Captain George E.\nPickett, Ninth Infantry, "to establish his company on Bellevue, or San Juan\nIsland, on some suitable position near the harbor at the southeastern\nextremity." This order was promptly obeyed and a military post was\nestablished at the place designated. The force was afterwards increased, so\nthat by the last return the whole number of troops then on the island\namounted in the aggregate to 691 men.</p>\n\n<p>Whilst I do not deem it proper on the present occasion to go further into\nthe subject and discuss the weight which ought to be attached to the\nstatements of the British colonial authorities contesting the accuracy of\nthe information on which the gallant General acted, it was due to him that\nI should thus present his own reasons for issuing the order to Captain\nPickett. From these it is quite clear his object was to prevent the British\nauthorities on Vancouvers Island from exercising jurisdiction over American\nresidents on the island of San Juan, as well as to protect them against the\nincursions of the Indians. Much excitement prevailed for some time\nthroughout that region, and serious danger of collision between the parties\nwas apprehended. The British had a large naval force in the vicinity, and\nit is but an act of simple justice to the admiral on that station to state\nthat he wisely and discreetly forbore to commit any hostile act, but\ndetermined to refer the whole affair to his Government and await their\ninstructions.</p>\n\n<p>This aspect of the matter, in my opinion, demanded serious attention. It\nwould have been a great calamity for both nations had they been\nprecipitated into acts of hostility, not on the question of title to the\nisland, but merely concerning what should be its condition during the\nintervening period whilst the two Governments might be employed in settling\nthe question to which of them it belongs. For this reason\nLieutenant-General Scott was dispatched, on the 17th of September last, to\nWashington Territory to take immediate command of the United States forces\non the Pacific Coast, should he deem this necessary. The main object of his\nmission was to carry out the spirit of the precautionary arrangement\nbetween the late Secretary of State and the British minister, and thus to\npreserve the peace and prevent collision between the British and American\nauthorities pending the negotiations between the two Governments.\nEntertaining no doubt of the validity of our title, I need scarcely add\nthat in any event American citizens were to be placed on a footing at least\nas favorable as that of British subjects, it being understood that Captain\nPickett\'s company should remain on the island. It is proper to observe\nthat, considering the distance from the scene of action and in ignorance of\nwhat might have transpired on the spot before the General\'s arrival, it was\nnecessary to leave much to his discretion; and I am happy to state the\nevent has proven that this discretion could not have been intrusted to more\ncompetent hands. General Scott has recently returned from his mission,\nhaving successfully accomplished its objects, and there is no longer any\ngood reason to apprehend a collision between the forces of the two\ncountries during the pendency of the existing negotiations. I regret to\ninform you that there has been no improvement in the affairs of Mexico\nsince my last annual message, and I am again obliged to ask the earnest\nattention of Congress to the unhappy condition of that Republic.</p>\n\n<p>The constituent Congress of Mexico, which adjourned on the 17th February,\n1857, adopted a constitution and provided for a popular election. This took\nplace in the following July (1857), and General Comonfort was chosen\nPresident almost without opposition. At the same election a new Congress\nwas chosen, whose first session commenced on the 16th of September (1857).\nBy the constitution of 1857 the Presidential term was to begin on the 1st\nof December (1857) and continue for four years. On that day General\nComonfort appeared before the assembled Congress in the City of Mexico,\ntook the oath to support the new constitution, and was duly inaugurated as\nPresident. Within a month afterwards he had been driven from the capital\nand a military rebellion had assigned the supreme power of the Republic to\nGeneral Zuloaga. The constitution provided that in the absence of the\nPresident his office should devolve upon the chief justice of the supreme\ncourt; and General Comonfort having left the country, this functionary,\nGeneral Juarez, proceeded to form at Guanajuato a constitutional\nGovernment. Before this was officially known, however, at the capital the\nGovernment of Zuloaga had been recognized by the entire diplomatic corps,\nincluding the minister of the United States, as the de facto Government of\nMexico. The constitutional President, nevertheless, maintained his position\nwith firmness, and was soon established, with his cabinet, at Vera Cruz.\nMeanwhile the Government of Zuloaga was earnestly resisted in many parts of\nthe Republic, and even in the capital, a portion of the army having\npronounced against it, its functions were declared terminated, and an\nassembly of citizens was invited for the choice of a new President. This\nassembly elected General Miramort, but that officer repudiated the plan\nunder which he was chosen, and Zuloaga was thus restored to his previous\nposition. He assumed it, however, only to withdraw from it; and Miramon,\nhaving become by his appointment "President substitute," continues with\nthat title at the head of the insurgent party.</p>\n\n<p>In my last annual message I communicated to Congress the circumstances\nunder which the late minister of the United States suspended his official\nrelations with the central Government and withdrew from the country. It was\nimpossible to maintain friendly intercourse with a government like that at\nthe capital, under whose usurped authority wrongs were constantly\ncommitted, but never redressed. Had this been an established government,\nwith its power extending by the consent of the people over the whole of\nMexico, a resort to hostilities against it would have been quite\njustifiable, and, indeed, necessary. But the country was a prey to civil\nwar, and it was hoped that the success of the constitutional President\nmight lead to a condition of things less injurious to the United States.\nThis success became so probable that in January last I employed a reliable\nagent to visit Mexico and report to me the actual condition and prospects\nof the contending parties. In consequence of his report and from\ninformation which reached me from other sources favorable to the prospects\nof the constitutional cause, I felt justified in appointing a new minister\nto Mexico, who might embrace the earliest suitable opportunity of restoring\nour diplomatic relations with that Republic. For this purpose a\ndistinguished citizen of Maryland was selected, who proceeded on his\nmission on the 8th of March last, with discretionary authority to recognize\nthe Government of President Juarez if on his arrival in Mexico he should\nfind it entitled to such recognition according to the established practice\nof the United States.</p>\n\n<p>On the 7th of April following Mr. McLane presented his credentials to\nPresident Juarez, having no hesitation "in pronouncing the Government of\nJuarez to be the only existing government of the Republic." He was\ncordially received by the authorities at Vera Cruz, and they have ever\nsince manifested the most friendly disposition toward the United States.</p>\n\n<p>Unhappily, however, the constitutional Government has not been able to\nestablish its power over the whole Republic. It is supported by a large\nmajority of the people and the States, but there are important parts of the\ncountry where it can enforce no obedience.</p>\n\n<p>General Miramon maintains himself at the capital, and in some of the\ndistant Provinces there are military governors who pay little respect to\nthe decrees of either Government. In the meantime the excesses which always\nattend upon civil war, especially in Mexico, are constantly recurring.\nOutrages of the worst description are committed both upon persons and\nproperty. There is scarcely any form of injury which has not been suffered\nby our citizens in Mexico during the last few years. We have been nominally\nat peace with that Republic, but "so far as the interests of our commerce,\nor of our citizens who have visited the country as merchants, shipmasters,\nor in other capacities, are concerned, we might as well have been at war."\nLife has been insecure, property unprotected, and trade impossible except\nat a risk of loss which prudent men can not be expected to incur. Important\ncontracts, involving large expenditures, entered into by the central\nGovernment, have been set at defiance by the local governments. Peaceful\nAmerican residents, occupying their rightful possessions, have been\nsuddenly expelled the country, in defiance of treaties and by the mere\nforce of arbitrary power. Even the course of justice has not been safe from\ncontrol, and a recent decree of Miramort permits the intervention of\nGovernment in all suits where either party is a foreigner. Vessels of the\nUnited States have been seized without law, and a consular officer who\nprotested against such seizure has been fined and imprisoned for disrespect\nto the authorities. Military contributions have been levied in violation of\nevery principle of right, and the American who resisted the lawless demand\nhas had his property forcibly taken away and has been himself banished.\nFrom a conflict of authority in different parts of the country tariff\nduties which have been paid in one place have been exacted over again in\nanother place. Large numbers of our citizens have been arrested and\nimprisoned without any form of examination or any opportunity for a\nhearing, and even when released have only obtained their liberty after much\nsuffering and injury, and without any hope of redress. The wholesale\nmassacre of Crabbe and his associates without trial in Sonora, as well as\nthe seizure and murder of four sick Americans who had taken shelter in the\nhouse of an American upon the soil of the United States, was communicated\nto Congress at its last session. Murders of a still more atrocious\ncharacter have been committed in the very heart of Mexico, under the\nauthority of Miramon\'s Government, during the present year. Some of these\nwere only worthy of a barbarous age, and if they had not been dearly proven\nwould have seemed impossible in a country which claims to be civilized. Of\nthis description was the brutal massacre in April last, by order of General\nMarquez, of three American physicians who were seized in the hospital at\nTacubaya while attending upon the sick and the dying of both parties, and\nwithout trial, as without crime, were hurried away to speedy execution.\nLittle less shocking was the recent fate of Ormond Chase, who was shot in\nTepic on the 7th of August by order of the same Mexican general, not only\nwithout a trial, but without any conjecture by his friends of the cause of\nhis arrest. He is represented as a young man of good character and\nintelligence, who had made numerous friends in Tepic by the courage and\nhumanity which he had displayed on several trying occasions; and his death\nwas as unexpected as it was shocking to the whole community. Other outrages\nmight be enumerated, but these are sufficient to illustrate the wretched\nstate of the country and the unprotected condition of the persons and\nproperty of our citizens in Mexico.</p>\n\n<p>In all these cases our ministers have been constant and faithful in their\ndemands for redress, but both they and this Government, which they have\nsuccessively represented, have been wholly powerless to make their demands\neffective. Their testimony in this respect and in reference to the only\nremedy which in their judgments would meet the exigency has been both\nuniform and emphatic. "Nothing but a manifestation of the power of the\nGovernment of the United States," wrote our late minister in 1856, "and of\nits purpose to punish these wrongs will avail. I assure you that the\nuniversal belief here is that there is nothing to be apprehended from the\nGovernment of the United States, and that local Mexican officials can\ncommit these outrages upon American citizens with absolute impunity." "I\nhope the President," wrote our present minister in August last, "will feel\nauthorized to ask from Congress the power to enter Mexico with the military\nforces of the United States at the call of the constitutional authorities,\nin order to protect the citizens and the treaty rights of the United\nStates. Unless such a power is conferred upon him, neither the one nor the\nother will be respected in the existing state of anarchy and disorder, and\nthe outrages already perpetrated will never be chastised; and, as I assured\nyou in my No. 23, all these evils must increase until every vestige of\norder and government disappears from the country." I have been reluctantly\nled to the same opinion, and in justice to my countrymen who have suffered\nwrongs from Mexico and who may still suffer them I feel bound to announce\nthis conclusion to Congress.</p>\n\n<p>The case presented, however, is not merely a case of individual claims,\nalthough our just claims against Mexico have reached a very large amount;\nnor is it merely the case of protection to the lives and property of the\nfew Americans who may still remain in Mexico, although the life and\nproperty of every American citizen ought to be sacredly protected in every\nquarter of the world; but it is a question which relates to the future as\nwell as to the present and the past, and which involves, indirectly at\nleast, the whole subject of our duty to Mexico as a neighboring State. The\nexercise of the power of the United States in that country to redress the\nwrongs and protect the rights of our own citizens is none the less to be\ndesired because efficient and necessary aid may thus be rendered at the\nsame time to restore peace and order to Mexico itself. In the\naccomplishment of this result the people of the United States must\nnecessarily feel a deep and earnest interest. Mexico ought to be a rich and\nprosperous and powerful Republic. She possesses an extensive territory, a\nfertile soil, and an incalculable store of mineral wealth. She occupies an\nimportant position between the Gulf and the ocean for transit routes and\nfor commerce. Is it possible that such a country as this can be given up to\nanarchy and ruin without an effort from any quarter for its rescue and its\nsafety? Will the commercial nations of the world, which have so many\ninterests connected with it, remain wholly indifferent to such a result?\nCan the United States especially, which ought to share most largely in its\ncommercial intercourse, allow their immediate neighbor thus to destroy\nitself and injure them? Yet without support from some quarter it is\nimpossible to perceive how Mexico can resume her position among nations and\nenter upon a career which promises any good results. The aid which she\nrequires, and which the interests of all commercial countries require that\nshe should have, it belongs to this Government to render, not only by\nvirtue of our neighborhood to Mexico, along whose territory we have a\ncontinuous frontier of nearly a thousand miles, but by virtue also of our\nestablished policy, which is inconsistent with the intervention of any\nEuropean power in the domestic concerns of that Republic.</p>\n\n<p>The wrongs which we have suffered from Mexico are before the world and must\ndeeply impress every American citizen. A government which is either unable\nor unwilling to redress such wrongs is derelict to its highest duties. The\ndifficulty consists in selecting and enforcing the remedy. We may in vain\napply to the constitutional Government at Vera Cruz, although it is well\ndisposed to do us justice, for adequate redress. Whilst its authority is\nacknowledged in all the important ports and throughout the seacoasts of the\nRepublic, its power does not extend to the City of Mexico and the States in\nits vicinity, where nearly all the recent outrages have been committed on\nAmerican citizens. We must penetrate into the interior before we can reach\nthe offenders, and this can only be done by passing through the territory\nin the occupation of the constitutional Government. The most acceptable and\nleast difficult mode of accomplishing the object will be to act in concert\nwith that Government. Their consent and their aid might, I believe, be\nobtained; but if not, our obligation to protect our own citizens in their\njust rights secured by treaty would not be the less imperative. For these\nreasons I recommend to Congress to pass a law authorizing the President\nunder such conditions as they may deem expedient, to employ a sufficient\nmilitary force to enter Mexico for the purpose of obtaining indemnity for\nthe past and security for the future. I purposely refrain from any\nsuggestion as to whether this force shall consist of regular troops or\nvolunteers, or both. This question may be most appropriately left to the\ndecision of Congress. I would merely observe that should volunteers be\nselected such a force could be easily raised in this country among those\nwho sympathize with the sufferings of our unfortunate fellow-citizens in\nMexico and with the unhappy condition of that Republic. Such an accession\nto the forces of the constitutional Government would enable it soon to\nreach the City of Mexico and extend its power over the whole Republic. In\nthat event there is no reason to doubt that the just claims of our citizens\nwould be satisfied and adequate redress obtained for the injuries inflicted\nupon them. The constitutional Government have ever evinced a strong desire\nto do justice, and this might be secured in advance by a preliminary\ntreaty.</p>\n\n<p>It may be said that these measures will, at least indirectly, be\ninconsistent with our wise and settled policy not to interfere in the\ndomestic concerns of foreign nations. But does not the present case fairly\nconstitute an exception? An adjoining Republic is in a state of anarchy and\nconfusion from which she has proved wholly unable to extricate herself. She\nis entirely destitute of the power to maintain peace upon her borders or to\nprevent the incursions of banditti into our territory. In her fate and in\nher fortune, in her power to establish and maintain a settled government,\nwe have a far deeper interest, socially, commercially, and politically,\nthan any other nation. She is now a wreck upon the ocean, drifting about as\nshe is impelled by different factions. As a good neighbor, shall we not\nextend to her a helping hand to save her? If we do not, it would not be\nsurprising should some other nation undertake the task, and thus force us\nto interfere at last, under circumstances of increased difficulty, for the\nmaintenance of our established policy.</p>\n\n<p>I repeat the recommendation contained in my last annual message that\nauthority may be given to the President to establish one or more temporary\nmilitary posts across the Mexican line in Sonora and Chihuahua, where these\nmay be necessary to protect the lives and property of American and Mexican\ncitizens against the incursions and depredations of the Indians, as well as\nof lawless rovers, on that remote region. The establishment of one such\npost at a point called Arispe, in Sonora, in a country now almost\ndepopulated by the hostile inroads of the Indians from our side of the\nline, would, it is believed, have prevented much injury and many cruelties\nduring the past season. A state of lawlessness and violence prevails on\nthat distant frontier. Life and property are there wholly insecure. The\npopulation of Arizona, now numbering more than 10,000 souls, are\npractically destitute of government, of laws, or of any regular\nadministration of justice. Murder, rapine, and other crimes are committed\nwith impunity. I therefore again call the attention of Congress to the\nnecessity for establishing a Territorial government over Arizona.</p>\n\n<p>The treaty with Nicaragua of the 16th of February, 1857, to which I\nreferred in my last annual message, failed to receive the ratification of\nthe Government of that Republic, for reasons which I need not enumerate. A\nsimilar treaty has been since concluded between the parties, bearing date\non the 16th March, 1859, which has already been ratified by the Nicaraguan\nCongress. This will be immediately submitted to the Senate for their\nratification. Its provisions can not, I think, fail to be acceptable to the\npeople of both countries.</p>\n\n<p>Our claims against the Governments of Costa Rica and Nicaragua remain\nunredressed, though they are pressed in an earnest manner and not without\nhope of success.</p>\n\n<p>I deem it to be my duty once more earnestly to recommend to Congress the\npassage of a law authorizing the President to employ the naval force at his\ncommand for the purpose of protecting the lives and property of American\ncitizens passing in transit across the Panama, Nicaragua, and Tehuantepec\nroutes against sudden and lawless outbreaks and depredations. I shall not\nrepeat the arguments employed in former messages in support of this\nmeasure. Suffice it to say that the lives of many of our people and the\nsecurity of vast amounts of treasure passing and repassing over one or more\nof these routes between the Atlantic and Pacific may be deeply involved in\nthe action of Congress on this subject.</p>\n\n<p>I would also again recommend to Congress that authority be given to the\nPresident to employ the naval force to protect American merchant vessels,\ntheir crews and cargoes, against violent and lawless seizure and\nconfiscation in the ports of Mexico and the Spanish American States when\nthese countries may be in a disturbed and revolutionary condition. The mere\nknowledge that such an authority had been conferred, as I have already\nstated, would of itself in a great degree prevent the evil. Neither would\nthis require any additional appropriation for the naval service.</p>\n\n<p>The chief objection urged against the grant of this authority is that\nCongress by conferring it would violate the Constitution; that it would be\na transfer of the war-making, or, strictly speaking, the war-declaring,\npower to the Executive. If this were well rounded, it would, of course, be\nconclusive. A very brief examination, however, will place this objection at\nrest.</p>\n\n<p>Congress possess the sole and exclusive power under the Constitution "to\ndeclare war." They alone can "raise and support armies" and "provide and\nmaintain a navy." But after Congress shall have declared war and provided\nthe force necessary to carry it on the President, as Commander in Chief of\nthe Army and Navy, can alone employ this force in making war against the\nenemy. This is the plain language, and history proves that it was the\nwell-known intention of the framers, of the Constitution.</p>\n\n<p>It will not be denied that the general "power to declare war" is without\nlimitation and embraces within itself not only what writers on the law of\nnations term a public or perfect war, but also an imperfect war, and, in\nshort, every species of hostility, however confined or limited. Without the\nauthority of Congress the President can not fire a hostile gun in any case\nexcept to repel the attacks of an enemy. It will not be doubted that under\nthis power Congress could, if they thought proper, authorize the President\nto employ the force at his command to seize a vessel belonging to an\nAmerican citizen which had been illegally and unjustly captured in a\nforeign port and restore it to its owner. But can Congress only act after\nthe fact, after the mischief has been done? Have they no power to confer\nupon the President the authority in advance to furnish instant redress\nshould such a case afterwards occur? Must they wait until the mischief has\nbeen done, and can they apply the remedy only when it is too late? To\nconfer this authority to meet future cases under circumstances strictly\nspecified is as clearly within the war-declaring power as such an authority\nconferred upon the President by act of Congress after the deed had been\ndone. In the progress of a great nation many exigencies must arise\nimperatively requiring that Congress should authorize the President to act\npromptly on certain conditions which may or may not afterwards arise. Our\nhistory has already presented a number of such cases. I shall refer only to\nthe latest. Under the resolution of June 2, 1858, "for the adjustment of\ndifficulties with the Republic of Paraguay," the President is "authorized\nto adopt such measures and use such force as in his judgment may be\nnecessary and advisable in the event of a refusal of just satisfaction by\nthe Government of Paraguay." "Just satisfaction" for what? For "the attack\non the United States steamer Water Witch" and "other matters referred to in\nthe annual message of the President." Here the power is expressly granted\nupon the condition that the Government of Paraguay shall refuse to render\nthis "just satisfaction." In this and other similar cases Congress have\nconferred upon the President power in advance to employ the Army and Navy\nupon the happening of contingent future events; and this most certainly is\nembraced within the power to declare war.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if this conditional and contingent power could be constitutionally\nconferred upon the President in the case of Paraguay, why may it not be\nconferred for the purpose of protecting the lives and property of American\ncitizens in the event that they may be violently and unlawfully attacked in\npassing over the transit routes to and from California or assailed by the\nseizure of their vessels in a foreign port? To deny this power is to render\nthe Navy in a great degree useless for the protection of the lives and\nproperty of American citizens in countries where neither protection nor\nredress can be otherwise obtained.</p>\n\n<p>The Thirty-fifth Congress terminated on the 3d of March, 1859, without\nhaving passed the "act making appropriations for the service of the\nPost-Office Department during the fiscal year ending the 30th of June,\n1860," This act also contained an appropriation "to supply deficiencies in\nthe revenue of the Post-Office Department for the year ending 30th June,\n1859." I believe this is the first instance since the origin of the Federal\nGovernment, now more than seventy years ago, when any Congress went out of\nexistence without having passed all the general appropriation bills\nnecessary to carry on the Government until the regular period for the\nmeeting of a new Congress. This event imposed on the Executive a grave\nresponsibility. It presented a choice of evils.</p>\n\n<p>Had this omission of duty occurred at the first session of the last\nCongress, the remedy would have been plain. I might then have instantly\nrecalled them to complete their work, and this without expense to the\nGovernment. But on the 4th of March last there were fifteen of the\nthirty-three States which had not elected any Representatives to the\npresent Congress. Had Congress been called together immediately, these\nStates would have been virtually disfranchised. If an intermediate period\nhad been selected, several of the States would have been compelled to hold\nextra sessions of their legislatures, at great inconvenience and expense,\nto provide for elections at an earlier day than that previously fixed by\nlaw. In the regular course ten of these States would not elect until after\nthe beginning of August, and five of these ten not until October and\nNovember.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, when I came to examine carefully the condition of the\nPost-Office Department, I did not meet as many or as great difficulties as\nI had apprehended. Had the bill which failed been confined to\nappropriations for the fiscal year ending on the 30th June next, there\nwould have been no reason of pressing importance for the call of an extra\nsession. Nothing would become due on contracts (those with railroad\ncompanies only excepted) for carrying the mail for the first quarter of the\npresent fiscal year, commencing on the 1st of July, until the 1st of\nDecember--less than one week before the meeting of the present Congress.\nThe reason is that the mail contractors for this and the current year did\nnot complete their first quarter\'s service until the 30th September last,\nand by the terms of their contracts sixty days more are allowed for the\nsettlement of their accounts before the Department could be called upon for\npayment.</p>\n\n<p>The great difficulty and the great hardship consisted in the failure to\nprovide for the payment of the deficiency in the fiscal year ending the\n30th June, 1859. The Department had entered into contracts, in obedience to\nexisting laws, for the service of that fiscal year, and the contractors\nwere fairly entitled to their compensation as it became due. The deficiency\nas stated in the bill amounted to $3,838,728, but after a careful\nsettlement of all these accounts it has been ascertained that it amounts to\n$4,296,009. With the scanty means at his command the Postmaster-General has\nmanaged to pay that portion of this deficiency which occurred in the first\ntwo quarters of the past fiscal year, ending on the 31st December last. In\nthe meantime the contractors themselves, under these trying circumstances,\nhave behaved in a manner worthy of all commendation. They had one resource\nin the midst of their embarrassments. After the amount due to each of them\nhad been ascertained and finally settled according to law, this became a\nspecific debt of record against the United States, which enabled them to\nborrow money on this unquestionable security. Still, they were obliged to\npay interest in consequence of the default of Congress, and on every\nprinciple of justice ought to receive interest from the Government. This\ninterest should commence from the date when a warrant would have issued for\nthe payment of the principal had an appropriation been made for this\npurpose. Calculated up to the 1st December, it will not exceed $96,660--a\nsum not to be taken into account when contrasted with the great\ndifficulties and embarrassments of a public and private character, both to\nthe people and the States, which would have resulted from convening and\nholding a special session of Congress. For these reasons I recommend the\npassage of a bill at as early a day as may be practicable to provide for\nthe payment of the amount, with interest, due to these last-mentioned\ncontractors, as well as to make the necessary appropriations for the\nservice of the Post-Office Department for the current fiscal year.</p>\n\n<p>The failure to pass the Post-Office bill necessarily gives birth to serious\nreflections. Congress, by refusing to pass the general appropriation bills\nnecessary to carry on the Government, may not only arrest its action, but\nmight even destroy its existence. The Army, the Navy, the judiciary, in\nshort, every department of the Government, can no longer perform their\nfunctions if Congress refuse the money necessary for their support. If this\nfailure should teach the country the necessity of electing a full Congress\nin sufficient time to enable the President to convene them in any\nemergency, even immediately after the old Congress has expired, it will\nhave been productive of great good. In a time of sudden and alarming\ndanger, foreign or domestic, which all nations must expect to encounter in\ntheir progress, the very salvation of our institutions may be staked upon\nthe assembling of Congress without delay. If under such circumstances the\nPresident should find himself in the condition in which he was placed at\nthe close of the last Congress, with nearly half the States of the Union\ndestitute of representatives, the consequences might he disastrous. I\ntherefore recommend to Congress to carry into effect the provisions of the\nConstitution on this subject, and to pass a law appointing some day\nprevious to the 4th March in each year of odd number for the election of\nRepresentatives throughout all the States. They have already appointed a\nday for the election of electors for President and Vice-President, and this\nmeasure has been approved by the country.</p>\n\n<p>I would again express a most decided opinion in favor of the construction\nof a Pacific railroad, for the reasons stated in my two last annual\nmessages. When I reflect upon what would be the defenseless condition of\nour States and Territories west of the Rocky Mountains in case of a war\nwith a naval power sufficiently strong to interrupt all intercourse with\nthem by the routes across the Isthmus, I am still more convinced than ever\nof the vast importance of this railroad. I have never doubted the\nconstitutional competency of Congress to provide for its construction, but\nthis exclusively under the war-making power. Besides, the Constitution\nexpressly requires as an imperative duty that "the United States shall\nprotect each of them [the States] against invasion." I am at a loss to\nconceive how this protection can be afforded to California and Oregon\nagainst such a naval power by any other means. I repeat the opinion\ncontained in my last annual message that it would be inexpedient for the\nGovernment to undertake this great work by agents of its own appointment\nand under its direct and exclusive control. This would increase the\npatronage of the Executive to a dangerous extent and would foster a system\nof jobbing and corruption which no vigilance on the part of Federal\nofficials could prevent. The construction of this road ought, therefore, to\nbe intrusted to incorporated companies or other agencies who would exercise\nthat active and vigilant supervision over it which can be inspired alone by\na sense of corporate and individual interest. I venture to assert that the\nadditional cost of transporting troops, munitions of war, and necessary\nsupplies for the Army across the vast intervening plains to our possessions\non the Pacific Coast would be greater in such a war than the whole amount\nrequired to construct the road. And yet this resort would after all be\ninadequate for their defense and protection.</p>\n\n<p>We have yet scarcely recovered from the habits of extravagant expenditure\nproduced by our overflowing Treasury during several years prior to the\ncommencement of my Administration. The financial reverses which we have\nsince experienced ought to teach us all to scrutinize our expenditures with\nthe greatest vigilance and to reduce them to the lowest possible point. The\nExecutive Departments of the Government have devoted themselves to the\naccomplishment of this object with considerable success, as will appear\nfrom their different reports and estimates. To these I invite the scrutiny\nof Congress, for the purpose of reducing them still lower, if this be\npracticable consistent with the great public interests of the country. In\naid of the policy of retrenchment, I pledge myself to examine closely the\nbills appropriating lands or money, so that if any of these should\ninadvertently pass both Houses, as must sometimes be the case, I may afford\nthem an opportunity for reconsideration. At the same time, we ought never\nto forget that true public economy consists not in withholding the means\nnecessary to accomplish important national objects confided to us by the\nConstitution, but in taking care that the money appropriated for these\npurposes shall be faithfully and frugally expended.</p>\n\n<p>It will appear from the report of the Secretary of the Treasury that it is\nextremely doubtful, to say the least, whether we shall be able to pass\nthrough the present and the next fiscal year without providing additional\nrevenue. This can only be accomplished by strictly confining the\nappropriations within the estimates of the different Departments, without\nmaking an allowance for any additional expenditures which Congress may\nthink proper, in their discretion, to authorize, and without providing for\nthe redemption of any portion of the $20,000,000 of Treasury notes which\nhave been already issued. In the event of a deficiency, which I consider\nprobable, this ought never to be supplied by a resort to additional loans.\nIt would be a ruinous practice in the days of peace and prosperity to go on\nincreasing the national debt to meet the ordinary expenses of the\nGovernment. This policy would cripple our resources and impair our credit\nin case the existence of war should render it necessary to borrow money.\nShould such a deficiency occur as I apprehend, I would recommend that the\nnecessary revenue be raised by an increase of our present duties on\nimports. I need not repeat the opinions expressed in my last annual message\nas to the best mode and manner of accomplishing this object, and shall now\nmerely observe that these have since undergone no change. The report of the\nSecretary of the Treasury will explain in detail the operations of that\nDepartment of the Government. The receipts into the Treasury from all\nsources during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1859, including the loan\nauthorized by the act of June 14, 1858, and the issues of Treasury notes\nauthorized by existing laws, were $81,692,471.01, which sum, with the\nbalance of $6,398,316.10 remaining in the Treasury at the commencement of\nthat fiscal year, made an aggregate for the service of the year of\n$88,090,787.11.</p>\n\n<p>The public expenditures during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1859,\namounted to $83,751,511.57. Of this sum $17,405,285.44 were applied to the\npayment of interest on the public debt and the redemption of the issues of\nTreasury notes. The expenditures for all other branches of the public\nservice during that fiscal year were therefore $66,346,226.13. The balance\nremaining in the Treasury on the 1st July, 1859, being the commencement of\nthe present fiscal year, was $4,339,275.54. The receipts into the Treasury\nduring the first quarter of the present fiscal year, commencing July 1,\n1859, were $20,618,865.85. Of this amount $3,821,300 was received on\naccount of the loan and the issue of Treasury notes, the amount of\n$16,797,565.85 having been received during the quarter from the ordinary\nsources of public revenue. The estimated receipts for the remaining three\nquarters of the present fiscal year, to June 30, 1860, are $50,426,400. Of\nthis amount it is estimated that $5,756,400 will be received for Treasury\nnotes which may be reissued under the fifth section of the act of 3d March\nlast, and $1,170,000 on account of the loan authorized by the act of June\n14, 1858, making $6,926,400 from these extraordinary sources, and\n$43,500,000 from the ordinary sources of the public revenue, making an\naggregate, with the balance in the Treasury on the 1st July, 1859, of\n$75,384,541.89 for the estimated means of the present fiscal year, ending\nJune 30, 1860.</p>\n\n<p>The expenditures during the first quarter of the present fiscal year were\n$20,007,174.76. Four million six hundred and sixty-four thousand three\nhundred and sixty-six dollars and seventy-six cents of this sum were\napplied to the payment of interest on the public debt and the redemption of\nthe issues of Treasury notes, and the remainder, being $15,342,808, were\napplied to ordinary expenditures during the quarter. The estimated\nexpenditures during the remaining three quarters, to June 30, 1860, are\n$40,995,558.23, of which sum $2,886,621.34 are estimated for the interest\non the public debt. The ascertained and estimated expenditures for the\nfiscal year ending June 30, 1860, on account of the public debt are\naccordingly $7,550,988.10, and for the ordinary expenditures of the\nGovernment $53,451,744.89, making an aggregate of $61,002,732.99, leaving\nan estimated balance in the Treasury on June 30, 1860, of $14,381,808.40.</p>\n\n<p>The estimated receipts during the next fiscal year, ending June 30, 1861,\nare $66,225,000, which, with the balance estimated, as before stated, as\nremaining in the Treasury on the 30th June, 1860, will make an aggregate\nfor the service of the next fiscal year of $80,606,808.40.</p>\n\n<p>The estimated expenditures during the next fiscal year, ending 30th June,\n1861, are $66,714,928.79. Of this amount $3,386,621.34 will be required to\npay the interest on the public debt, leaving the sum of $63,328,307.45 for\nthe estimated ordinary expenditures during the fiscal year ending 30th\nJune, 1861. Upon these estimates a balance will be left in the Treasury on\nthe 30th June, 1861, of $13,891,879.61. But this balance, as well as that\nestimated to remain in the Treasury on the 1st July, 1860, will be reduced\nby such appropriations as shall be made by law to carry into effect certain\nIndian treaties during the present fiscal year, asked for by the Secretary\nof the Interior, to the amount of $539,350; and upon the estimates of the\npostmaster-General for the service of his Department the last fiscal year,\nending 30th June, 1859, amounting to $4,296,009, together with the further\nestimate of that officer for the service of the present fiscal year, ending\n30th June, 1860, being $5,526,324, making an aggregate of $10,361,683.</p>\n\n<p>Should these appropriations be made as requested by the proper Departments,\nthe balance in the Treasury on the 30th June, 1861, will not, it is\nestimated, exceed $3,530,196.61.</p>\n\n<p>I transmit herewith the reports of the Secretaries of War, of the Navy, of\nthe Interior, and of the postmaster-General. They each contain valuable\ninformation and important recommendations well worthy of the serious\nconsideration of Congress. It will appear from the report of the Secretary\nof War that the Army expenditures have been materially reduced by a system\nof rigid economy, which in his opinion offers every guaranty that the\nreduction will be permanent. The estimates of the Department for the next\nhave been reduced nearly $2,000,000 below the estimates for the present\nfiscal year and $500,000 below the amount granted for this year at the last\nsession of Congress.</p>\n\n<p>The expenditures of the Post-Office Department during the past fiscal year,\nending on the 30th June, 1859, exclusive of payments for mail service\nspecially provided for by Congress out of the general Treasury, amounted to\n$14,964,493.33 and its receipts to $7,968,484.07, showing a deficiency to\nbe supplied from the Treasury of $6,996,009.26, against $5,235,677.15 for\nthe year ending 30th June, 1858. The increased cost of transportation,\ngrowing out of the expansion of the service required by Congress, explains\nthis rapid augmentation of the expenditures. It is gratifying, however, to\nobserve an increase of receipts for the year ending on the 30th of June,\n1859, equal to $481,691.21 compared with those in the year ending on the\n30th June, 1858.</p>\n\n<p>It is estimated that the deficiency for the current fiscal year will be\n$5,988,424.04, but that for the year ending 30th June, 1861, it will not\nexceed $1,342,473.90 should Congress adopt the measures of reform proposed\nand urged by the Postmaster-General. Since the month of March retrenchments\nhave been made in the expenditures amounting to $1,826,471 annually, which,\nhowever, did not take effect until after the commencement of the present\nfiscal year. The period seems to have arrived for determining the question\nwhether this Department shall become a permanent and ever-increasing charge\nupon the Treasury, or shall be permitted to resume the self-sustaining\npolicy which had so long controlled its administration. The course of\nlegislation recommended by the Postmaster-General for the relief of the\nDepartment from its present embarrassments and for restoring it to its\noriginal independence is deserving of your early and earnest\nconsideration.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion I would again commend to the just liberality of Congress the\nlocal interests of the District of Columbia. Surely the city bearing the\nname of Washington, and destined, I trust, for ages to be the capital of\nour united, free, and prosperous Confederacy, has strong claims on our\nfavorable regard.\n</p>\n\t\t\t<div class="textNav"><a href="#top">^ Return to top</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>\n\t<div id="footer"><strong><em>State of the Union</em></strong> is a project\n\t\tby Brad Borevitz at <a href="http://www.onetwothree.net">onetwothree.net</a></div>\n</div>\n<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">\n</script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n_uacct = "UA-410742-1";\nurchinTracker();\n</script>\n</body>\n<!-- InstanceEnd -->\n</html>\n'
