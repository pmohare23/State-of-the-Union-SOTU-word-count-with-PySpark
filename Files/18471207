The\nrepresentatives of the States and of the people come fresh from their\nconstituents to take counsel together for the common good.</p>\n\n<p>After an existence of near three-fourths of a century as a free and\nindependent Republic, the problem no longer remains to be solved whether\nman is capable of self-government. The success of our admirable system is a\nconclusive refutation of the theories of those in other countries who\nmaintain that a "favored few" are born to rule and that the mass of mankind\nmust be governed by force. Subject to no arbitrary or hereditary authority,\nthe people are the only sovereigns recognized by our Constitution.</p>\n\n<p>Numerous emigrants, of every lineage and language, attracted by the civil\nand religious freedom we enjoy and by our happy condition, annually crowd\nto our shores, and transfer their heart, not less than their allegiance, to\nthe country whose dominion belongs alone to the people. No country has been\nso much favored, or should acknowledge with deeper reverence the\nmanifestations of the divine protection. An all wise Creator directed and\nguarded us in our infant struggle for freedom and has constantly watched\nover our surprising progress until we have become one of the great nations\nof the earth.</p>\n\n<p>It is in a country thus favored, and under a Government in which the\nexecutive and legislative branches hold their authority for limited periods\nalike from the people, and where all are responsible to their respective\nconstituencies, that it is again my duty to communicate with Congress upon\nthe state of the Union and the present condition of public affairs.</p>\n\n<p>During the past year the most gratifying proofs are presented that our\ncountry has been blessed with a widespread and universal prosperity. There\nhas been no period since the Government was founded when all the industrial\npursuits of our people have been more successful or when labor in all\nbranches of business has received a fairer or better reward. From our\nabundance we have been enabled to perform the pleasing duty of furnishing\nfood for the starving millions of less favored countries.</p>\n\n<p>In the enjoyment of the bounties of Providence at home such as have rarely\nfallen to the lot of any people, it is cause of congratulation that our\nintercourse with all the powers of the earth except Mexico continues to be\nof an amicable character.</p>\n\n<p>It has ever been our cherished policy to cultivate peace and good will with\nall nations, and this policy has been steadily pursued by me. No change has\ntaken place in our relations with Mexico since the adjournment of the last\nCongress. The war in which the United States were forced to engage with the\nGovernment of that country still continues.</p>\n\n<p>I deem it unnecessary, after the full exposition of them contained in my\nmessage of the 11th of May, 1846, and in my annual message at the\ncommencement of the session of Congress in December last, to reiterate the\nserious causes of complaint which we had against Mexico before she\ncommenced hostilities.</p>\n\n<p>It is sufficient on the present occasion to say that the wanton violation\nof the rights of person and property of our citizens committed by Mexico,\nher repeated acts of bad faith through a long series of years, and her\ndisregard of solemn treaties stipulating for indemnity to our injured\ncitizens not only constituted ample cause of war on our part, but were of\nsuch an aggravated character as would have justified us before the whole\nworld in resorting to this extreme remedy. With an anxious desire to avoid\na rupture between the two countries, we forbore for years to assert our\nclear rights by force, and continued to seek redress for the wrongs we had\nsuffered by amicable negotiation in the hope that Mexico might yield to\npacific counsels and the demands of justice. In this hope we were\ndisappointed. Our minister of peace sent to Mexico was insultingly\nrejected. The Mexican Government refused even to hear the terms of\nadjustment which he was authorized to propose, and finally, under wholly\nunjustifiable pretexts, involved the two countries in war by invading the\nterritory of the State of Texas, striking the first blow, and shedding the\nblood of our citizens on our own soil.</p>\n\n<p>Though the United States were the aggrieved nation, Mexico commenced the\nwar, and we were compelled in self-defense to repel the invader and to\nvindicate the national honor and interests by prosecuting it with vigor\nuntil we could obtain a just and honorable peace. On learning that\nhostilities had been commenced by Mexico I promptly communicated that fact,\naccompanied with a succinct statement of our other causes of complaint\nagainst Mexico, to Congress, and that body, by the act of the 13th of May,\n1846, declared that "by the act of the Republic of Mexico a state of war\nexists between that Government and the United States." This act declaring\n"the war to exist by the act of the Republic of Mexico," and making\nprovision for its prosecution "to a speedy and successful termination," was\npassed with great unanimity by Congress, there being but two negative votes\nin the Senate and but fourteen in the House of Representatives.</p>\n\n<p>The existence of the war having thus been declared by Congress, it became\nmy duty under the Constitution and the laws to conduct and prosecute it.\nThis duty has been performed, and though at every stage of its progress I\nhave manifested a willingness to terminate it by a just peace, Mexico has\nrefused to accede to any terms which could be accepted by the United States\nconsistently with the national honor and interest.</p>\n\n<p>The rapid and brilliant successes of our arms and the vast extent of the\nenemy\'s territory which had been overrun and conquered before the close of\nthe last session of Congress were fully known to that body. Since that time\nthe war has been prosecuted with increased energy, and, I am gratified to\nstate, with a success which commands universal admiration.. History\npresents no parallel of so many glorious victories achieved by any nation\nwithin so short a period. Our Army, regulars and volunteers, have covered\nthemselves with imperishable honors. Whenever and wherever our forces have\nencountered the enemy, though he was in vastly superior numbers and often\nintrenched in fortified positions of his own selection and of great\nstrength, he has been defeated. Too much praise can not be bestowed upon\nour officers and men, regulars and volunteers, for their gallantry,\ndiscipline, indomitable courage, and perseverance, all seeking the post of\ndanger and vying with each other in deeds of noble daring.</p>\n\n<p>While every patriot\'s heart must exult and a just national pride animate\nevery bosom in beholding the high proofs of courage, consummate military\nskill, steady discipline, and humanity to the vanquished enemy exhibited by\nour gallant Army, the nation is called to mourn over the loss of many brave\nofficers and soldiers, who have fallen in defense of their country\'s honor\nand interests. The brave dead met their melancholy fate in a foreign land,\nnobly discharging their duty, and with their country\'s flag waving\ntriumphantly in the face of the foe. Their patriotic deeds are justly\nappreciated, and will long be remembered by their grateful countrymen. The\nparental care of the Government they loved and served should be extended to\ntheir surviving families.</p>\n\n<p>Shortly after the adjournment of the last session of Congress the\ngratifying intelligence was received of the signal victory of Buena Vista,\nand of the fall of the city of Vera Cruz, and with it the strong castle of\nSan Juan de Ulloa, by which it was defended. Believing that after these and\nother successes so honorable to our arms and so disastrous to Mexico the\nperiod was propitious to afford her another opportunity, if she thought\nproper to embrace it, to enter into negotiations for peace, a commissioner\nwas appointed to proceed to the headquarters of our Army with full powers\nto enter upon negotiations and to conclude a just and honorable treaty of\npeace. He was not directed to make any new overtures of peace, but was the\nbearer of a dispatch from the Secretary of State of the United States to\nthe minister of foreign affairs of Mexico, in reply to one received from\nthe latter of the 22d of February, 1847, in which the Mexican Government\nwas informed of his appointment and of his presence at the headquarters of\nour Army, and that he was invested with full powers to conclude a\ndefinitive treaty of peace whenever the Mexican Government might signify a\ndesire to do so. While I was unwilling to subject the United States to\nanother indignant refusal, I was yet resolved that the evils of the war\nshould not be protracted a day longer than might be rendered absolutely\nnecessary by the Mexican Government.</p>\n\n<p>Care was taken to give no instructions to the commissioner which could in\nany way interfere with our military operations or relax our energies in the\nprosecution of the war. He possessed no authority in any manner to control\nthese operations. He was authorized to exhibit his instructions to the\ngeneral in command of the Army, and in the event of a treaty being\nconcluded and ratified on the part of Mexico he was directed to give him\nnotice of that fact. On the happening of such contingency, and on receiving\nnotice thereof, the general in command was instructed by the Secretary of\nWar to suspend further active military operations until further orders.\nThese instructions were given with a view to intermit hostilities until the\ntreaty thus ratified by Mexico could be transmitted to Washington and\nreceive the action of the Government of the United States. The commissioner\nwas also directed on reaching the Army to deliver to the general in command\nthe dispatch which he bore from the Secretary of State to the minister of\nforeign affairs of Mexico, and on receiving it the general was instructed\nby the Secretary of War to cause it to be transmitted to the commander of\nthe Mexican forces, with a quest that it might be communicated to his\nGovernment. The commissioner did not reach the headquarters of the Army\nuntil after another brilliant victory had crowned our arms at Cerro Gordo.\nThe dispatch which he bore from the Secretary of War to the general in\ncommand of the Army was received by that officer, then at Jalapa, on the\n7th of May, 1847, together with the dispatch from the Secretary of State to\nthe minister of foreign affairs of Mexico, having been transmitted to him\nfrom Vera Cruz. The commissioner arrived at the headquarters of the Army a\nfew days afterwards. His presence with the Army and his diplomatic\ncharacter were made known to the Mexican Government from Puebla on the 12th\nof June, 1847, by the transmission of the dispatch from the Secretary of\nState to the minister of foreign affairs of Mexico.</p>\n\n<p>Many weeks elapsed after its receipt, and no overtures were made nor was\nany desire expressed by the Mexican Government to enter into negotiations\nfor peace.</p>\n\n<p>Our Army pursued its march upon the capital, and as it approached it was\nmet by formidable resistance. Our forces first encountered the enemy, and\nachieved signal victories in the severely contested battles of Contreras\nand Churubusco. It was not until after these actions had resulted in\ndecisive victories and the capital of the enemy was within our power that\nthe Mexican Government manifested any disposition to enter into\nnegotiations for peace, and even then, as events have proved, there is too\nmuch reason to believe they were insincere, and that in agreeing to go\nthrough the forms of negotiation the object was to gain time to strengthen\nthe defenses of their capital and to prepare for fresh resistance.</p>\n\n<p>The general in command of the Army deemed it expedient to suspend\nhostilities temporarily by entering into an armistice with a view to the\nopening of negotiations. Commissioners were appointed on the part of Mexico\nto meet the commissioner on the part of the United States. The result of\nthe conferences which took place between these functionaries of the two\nGovernments was a failure to conclude a treaty of peace. The commissioner\nof the United States took with him the project of a treaty already\nprepared, by the terms of which the indemnity required by the United States\nwas a cession of territory.</p>\n\n<p>It is well known that the only indemnity which it is in the power of Mexico\nto make in satisfaction of the just and long-deferred claims of our\ncitizens against her and the only means by which she can reimburse the\nUnited States for the expenses of the war is a cession to the United States\nof a portion of her territory. Mexico has no money to pay, and no other\nmeans of making the required indemnity. If we refuse this, we can obtain\nnothing else. To reject indemnity by refusing to accept a cession of\nterritory would be to abandon all our just demands, and to wage the war,\nbearing all its expenses, without a purpose or definite object.</p>\n\n<p>A state of war abrogates treaties previously existing between the\nbelligerents and a treaty of peace puts an end to all claims for indemnity\nfor tortious acts committed under the authority of one government against\nthe citizens or subjects of another unless they are provided for in its\nstipulations. A treaty of peace which would terminate the existing war\nwithout providing for indemnity would enable Mexico, the acknowledged\ndebtor and herself the aggressor in the war, to relieve herself from her\njust liabilities. By such a treaty our citizens who hold just demands\nagainst her would have no remedy either against Mexico or their own\nGovernment. Our duty to these citizens must forever prevent such a peace,\nand no treaty which does not provide ample means of discharging these\ndemands can receive my sanction.</p>\n\n<p>A treaty of peace should settle all existing differences between the two\ncountries. If an adequate cession of territory should be made by such a\ntreaty, the United States should release Mexico from all her liabilities\nand assume their payment to our own citizens. If instead of this the United\nStates were to consent to a treaty by which Mexico should again engage to\npay the heavy amount of indebtedness which a just indemnity to our\nGovernment and our citizens would impose on her, it is notorious that she\ndoes not possess the means to meet such an undertaking. From such a treaty\nno result could be anticipated but the same irritating disappointments\nwhich have heretofore attended the violations of similar treaty\nstipulations on the part of Mexico. Such a treaty would be but a temporary\ncessation of hostilities, without the restoration of the friendship and\ngood understanding which should characterize the future intercourse between\nthe two countries.</p>\n\n<p>That Congress contemplated the acquisition of territorial indemnity when\nthat body made provision for the prosecution of the war is obvious.\nCongress could not have meant when, in May, 1846, they appropriated\n$10,000,000 and authorized the President to employ the militia and naval\nand military forces of the United States and to accept the services of\n50,000 volunteers to enable him to prosecute the war, and when, at their\nlast session, and after our Army had invaded Mexico, they made additional\nappropriations and authorized the raising of additional troops for the same\npurpose, that no indemnity was to be obtained from Mexico at the conclusion\nof the war; and yet it was certain that if no Mexican territory was\nacquired no indemnity could be obtained. It is further manifest that\nCongress contemplated territorial indemnity from the fact that at their\nlast session an act was passed, upon the Executive recommendation,\nappropriating $3,000,000 with that express object. This appropriation was\nmade "to enable the President to conclude a treaty of peace, limits, and\nboundaries with the Republic of Mexico, to be used by him in the event that\nsaid treaty, when signed by the authorized agents of the two Governments\nand duly ratified by Mexico, shall call for the expenditure of the same or\nany part thereof." The object of asking this appropriation was distinctly\nstated in the several messages on the subject which I communicated to\nCongress. Similar appropriations made in 1803 and 1806, which were referred\nto, were intended to be applied in part consideration for the cession of\nLouisiana and the Floridas. In like manner it was anticipated that in\nsettling the terms of a treaty of "limits and boundaries" with Mexico a\ncession of territory estimated to be of greater value than the amount of\nour demands against her might be obtained, and that the prompt payment of\nthis sum in part consideration for the territory ceded, on the conclusion\nof a treaty and its ratification on her part, might be an inducement with\nher to make such a cession of territory as would be satisfactory to the\nUnited States; and although the failure to conclude such a treaty has\nrendered it unnecessary to use any part of the $3,000,000 appropriated by\nthat act, and the entire sum remains in the Treasury, it is still\napplicable to that object should the contingency occur making such\napplication proper.</p>\n\n<p>The doctrine of no territory is the doctrine of no indemnity, and if\nsanctioned would be a public acknowledgment that our country was wrong and\nthat the war declared by Congress with extraordinary unanimity was unjust\nand should be abandoned--an admission unfounded in fact and degrading to\nthe national character.</p>\n\n<p>The terms of the treaty proposed by the United States were not only just to\nMexico, but, considering the character and amount of our claims, the\nunjustifiable and unprovoked commencement of hostilities by her, the\nexpenses of the war to which we have been subjected, and the success which\nhad attended our arms, were deemed to be of a most liberal character.</p>\n\n<p>The commissioner of the United States was authorized to agree to the\nestablishment of the Rio Grande as the boundary from its entrance into the\nGulf to its intersection with the southern boundary of New Mexico, in north\nlatitude about 32 degree, and to obtain a cession to the United States of\nthe Provinces of New Mexico and the Californias and the privilege of the\nright of way across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The boundary of the Rio\nGrande and the cession to the United States of New Mexico and Upper\nCalifornia constituted an ultimatum which our commissioner was under no\ncircumstances to yield.</p>\n\n<p>That it might be manifest, not only to Mexico, but to all other nations,\nthat the United States were not disposed to take advantage of a feeble\npower by insisting upon wrestling from her all the other Provinces,\nincluding many of her principal towns and cities, which we had conquered\nand held in our military occupation but were willing to conclude a treaty\nin a spirit of liberality, our commissioner was authorized to stipulate for\nthe restoration to Mexico of all our other conquests.</p>\n\n<p>As the territory to be acquired by the boundary proposed might be estimated\nto be of greater value than a fair equivalent for our just demands, our\ncommissioner was authorized to stipulate for the payment of such additional\npecuniary consideration as was deemed reasonable.</p>\n\n<p>The terms of a treaty proposed by the Mexican commissioners were wholly\ninadmissible. They negotiated as if Mexico were the victorious, and not the\nvanquished, party. They must have known that their ultimatum could never be\naccepted. It required the United States to dismember Texas by surrendering\nto Mexico that part of the territory of that State lying between the Nueces\nand the Rio Grande, included within her limits by her laws when she was an\nindependent republic, and when she was annexed to the United States and\nadmitted by Congress as one of the States of our Union. It contained no\nprovision for the payment by Mexico of the just claims of our citizens. It\nrequired indemnity to Mexican citizens for injuries they may have sustained\nby our troops in the prosecution of the war. It demanded the right for\nMexico to levy and collect the Mexican tariff of duties on goods imported\ninto her ports while in our military occupation during the war, and the\nowners of which had paid to officers of the United States the military\ncontributions which had been levied upon them; and it offered to cede to\nthe United States, for a pecuniary consideration, that part of Upper\nCalifornia lying north of latitude 37 . Such were the unreasonable\nterms proposed by the Mexican commissioners.</p>\n\n<p>The cession to the United States by Mexico of the Provinces of New Mexico\nand the Californias, as proposed by the commissioner of the United States,\nit was believed would be more in accordance with the convenience and\ninterests of both nations than any other cession of territory which it was\nprobable Mexico could be induced to make.</p>\n\n<p>It is manifest to all who have observed the actual condition of the Mexican\nGovernment for some years past and at present that if these Provinces\nshould be retained by her she could not long continue to hold and govern\nthem. Mexico is too feeble a power to govern these Provinces, lying as they\ndo at a distance of more than 1,000 miles from her capital, and if\nattempted to be retained by her they would constitute but for a short time\neven nominally a part of her dominions. This would be especially the case\nwith Upper California.</p>\n\n<p>The sagacity of powerful European nations has long since directed their\nattention to the commercial importance of that Province, and there can be\nlittle doubt that the moment the United States shall relinquish their\npresent occupation of it and their claim to it as indemnity an effort would\nbe made by some foreign power to possess it, either by conquest or by\npurchase. If no foreign government should acquire it in either of these\nmodes, an independent revolutionary government would probably be\nestablished by the inhabitants and such foreigners as may remain in or\nremove to the country as soon as it shall be known that the United States\nhave abandoned it. Such a government would be too feeble long to maintain\nits separate independent existence, and would finally become annexed to or\nbe a dependent colony of some more powerful state. Should any foreign\ngovernment attempt to possess it as a colony, or otherwise to incorporate\nit with itself, the principle avowed by President Monroe in 1824, and\nreaffirmed in my first annual message, that no foreign power shall with our\nconsent be permitted to plant or establish any new colony or dominion on\nany part of the North American continent must be maintained. In maintaining\nthis principle and in resisting its invasion by any foreign power we might\nbe involved in other wars more expensive and more difficult than that in\nwhich we are now engaged. The Provinces of New Mexico and the Californias\nare contiguous to the territories of the United States, and if brought\nunder the government of our laws their resources--mineral, agricultural,\nmanufacturing, and commercial--would soon be developed.</p>\n\n<p>Upper California is bounded on the north by our Oregon possessions, and if\nheld by the United States would soon be settled by a hardy, enterprising,\nand intelligent portion of our population. The Bay of San Francisco and\nother harbors along the Californian coast would afford shelter for our\nNavy, for our numerous whale ships, and other merchant vessels employed in\nthe Pacific Ocean, and would in a short period become the marts of an\nextensive and profitable commerce with China and other countries of the\nEast.</p>\n\n<p>These advantages, in which the whole commercial world would participate,\nwould at once be secured to the United States by the cession of this\nterritory; while it is certain that as long as it remains a part of the\nMexican dominions they can be enjoyed neither by Mexico herself nor by any\nother nation.</p>\n\n<p>New Mexico is a frontier Province, and has never been of any considerable\nvalue to Mexico. From its locality it is naturally connected with our\nWestern settlements. The territorial limits of the State of Texas, too, as\ndefined by her laws before her admission into our Union, embrace all that\nportion of New Mexico lying east of the Rio Grande, while Mexico still\nclaims to hold this territory as a part of her dominions. The adjustment of\nthis question of boundary is important.</p>\n\n<p>There is another consideration which induced the belief that the Mexican\nGovernment might even desire to place this Province under the protection of\nthe Government of the United States. Numerous bands of fierce and warlike\nsavages wander over it and upon its borders. Mexico has been and must\ncontinue to be too feeble to restrain them from committing depredations,\nrobberies, and murders, not only upon the inhabitants of New Mexico itself,\nbut upon those of the other northern States of Mexico. It would be a\nblessing to all these northern States to have their citizens protected\nagainst them by the power of the United States. At this moment many\nMexicans, principally females and children, are in captivity among them. If\nNew Mexico were held and governed by the United States, we could\neffectually prevent these tribes from committing such outrages, and compel\nthem to release these captives and restore them to their families and\nfriends.</p>\n\n<p>In proposing to acquire New Mexico and the Californias, it was known that\nbut an inconsiderable portion of the Mexican people would be transferred\nwith them, the country embraced within these Provinces being chiefly an\nuninhabited region.</p>\n\n<p>These were the leading considerations which induced me to authorize the\nterms of peace which were proposed to Mexico. They were rejected, and,\nnegotiations being at an end, hostilities were renewed. An assault was made\nby our gallant Army upon the strongly fortified places near the gates of\nthe City of Mexico and upon the city itself, and after several days of\nsevere conflict the Mexican forces, vastly superior in number to our own,\nwere driven from the city, and it was occupied by our troops.</p>\n\n<p>Immediately after information was received of the unfavorable result of the\nnegotiations, believing that his continued presence with the Army could be\nproductive of no good, I determined to recall our commissioner. A dispatch\nto this effect was transmitted to him on the 6th of October last. The\nMexican Government will be informed of his recall, and that in the existing\nstate of things I shall not deem it proper to make any further overtures of\npeace, but shall be at all times ready to receive and consider any\nproposals which may be made by Mexico.</p>\n\n<p>Since the liberal proposition of the United States was authorized to be\nmade, in April last, large expenditures have been incurred and the precious\nblood of many of our patriotic fellow-citizens has been shed in the\nprosecution of the war. This consideration and the obstinate perseverance\nof Mexico in protracting the war must influence the terms of peace which it\nmay be deemed proper hereafter to accept. Our arms having been everywhere\nvictorious, having subjected to our military occupation a large portion of\nthe enemy\'s country, including his capital, and negotiations for peace\nhaving failed, the important questions arise, in what manner the war ought\nto be prosecuted and what should be our future policy. I can not doubt that\nwe should secure and render available the conquests which we have already\nmade, and that with this view we should hold and occupy by our naval and\nmilitary forces all the ports, towns, cities, and Provinces now in our\noccupation or which may hereafter fall into our possession; that we should\npress forward our military operations and levy such military contributions\non the enemy as may, as far as practicable, defray the future expenses of\nthe war.</p>\n\n<p>Had the Government of Mexico acceded to the equitable and liberal terms\nproposed, that mode of adjustment would have been preferred, Mexico having\ndeclined to do this and failed to offer any other terms which could be\naccepted by the United States, the national honor, no less than the public\ninterests, requires that the war should be prosecuted with increased energy\nand power until a just and satisfactory peace can be obtained. In the\nmeantime, as Mexico refuses all indemnity, we should adopt measures to\nindemnify ourselves by appropriating permanently a portion of her\nterritory. Early after the commencement of the war New Mexico and the\nCalifornias were taken possession of by our forces. Our military and naval\ncommanders were ordered to conquer and hold them, subject to be disposed of\nby a treaty of peace.</p>\n\n<p>These Provinces are now in our undisputed occupation, and have been so for\nmany months, all resistance on the part of Mexico having ceased within\ntheir limits. I am satisfied that they should never be surrendered to\nMexico. Should Congress concur with me in this opinion, and that they\nshould be retained by the United States as indemnity, I can perceive no\ngood reason why the civil jurisdiction and laws of the United States should\nnot at once be extended over them. To wait for a treaty of peace such as we\nare willing to make, by which our relations toward them would not be\nchanged, can not be good policy; whilst our own interest and that of the\npeople inhabiting them require that a stable, responsible, and free\ngovernment under our authority should as soon as possible be established\nover them. Should Congress, therefore, determine to hold these Provinces\npermanently, and that they shall hereafter be considered as constituent\nparts of our country, the early establishment of Territorial governments\nover them will be important for the more perfect protection of persons and\nproperty; and I recommend that such Territorial governments be established.\nIt will promote peace and tranquillity among the inhabitants, by allaying\nall apprehension that they may still entertain of being again subjected to\nthe jurisdiction of Mexico. I invite the early and favorable consideration\nof Congress to this important subject.</p>\n\n<p>Besides New Mexico and the Californias, there are other Mexican Provinces\nwhich have been reduced to our possession by conquest. These other Mexican\nProvinces are now governed by our military and naval commanders under the\ngeneral authority which is conferred upon a conqueror by the laws of war.\nThey should continue to be held, as a means of coercing Mexico to accede to\njust terms of peace. Civil as well as military officers are required to\nconduct such a government. Adequate compensation, to be drawn from\ncontributions levied on the enemy, should be fixed by law for such officers\nas may be thus employed. What further provision may become necessary and\nwhat final disposition it may be proper to make of them must depend on the\nfuture progress of the war and the course which Mexico may think proper\nhereafter to pursue.</p>\n\n<p>With the views I entertain I can not favor the policy which has been\nsuggested, either to withdraw our Army altogether or to retire to a\ndesignated line and simply hold and defend it. To withdraw our Army\naltogether from the conquests they have made by deeds of unparalleled\nbravery, and at the expense of so much blood and treasure, in a just war on\nour part, and one which, by the act of the enemy, we could not honorably\nhave avoided, would be to degrade the nation in its own estimation and in\nthat of the world. To retire to a line and simply hold and defend it would\nnot terminate the war. On the contrary, it would encourage Mexico to\npersevere and tend to protract it indefinitely. It is not to be expected\nthat Mexico, after refusing to establish such a line as a permanent\nboundary when our victorious Army are in possession of her capital and in\nthe heart of her country, would permit us to hold it without resistance.\nThat she would continue the war, and in the most harassing and annoying\nforms, there can be no doubt. A border warfare of the most savage\ncharacter, extending over a long line, would be unceasingly waged. It would\nrequire a large army to be kept constantly in the field, stationed at posts\nand garrisons along such a line, to protect and defend it. The enemy,\nrelieved from the pressure of our arms on his coasts and in the populous\nparts of the interior, would direct his attention to this line, and,\nselecting an isolated post for attack, would concentrate his forces upon\nit. This would be a condition of affairs which the Mexicans, pursuing their\nfavorite system of guerrilla warfare, would probably prefer to any other.\nWere we to assume a defensive attitude on such a line, all the advantages\nof such a state of war would be on the side of the enemy. We could levy no\ncontributions upon him, or in any other way make him feel the pressure of\nthe war, but must remain inactive and await his approach, being in constant\nuncertainty at what point on the line or at what time he might make an\nassault. He may assemble and organize an overwhelming force in the interior\non his own side of the line, and, concealing his purpose, make a sudden\nassault upon some one of our posts so distant from any other as to prevent\nthe possibility of timely succor or reenforcements, and in this way our\ngallant Army would be exposed to the danger of being cut off in detail; or\nif by their unequaled bravery and prowess everywhere exhibited during this\nwar they should repulse the enemy, their numbers stationed at any one post\nmay be too small to pursue him. If the enemy be repulsed in one attack, he\nwould have nothing to do but to retreat to his own side of the line, and,\nbeing in no fear of a pursuing army, may reenforce himself at leisure for\nanother attack on the same or some other post. He may, too, cross the line\nbetween our posts, make rapid incursions into the country which we hold,\nmurder the inhabitants, commit depredations on them, and then retreat to\nthe interior before a sufficient force can be concentrated to pursue him.\nSuch would probably be the harassing character of a mere defensive war on\nour part. If our forces when attacked, or threatened with attack, be\npermitted to cross the line, drive back the enemy, and conquer him, this\nwould be again to invade the enemy\'s country after having lost all the\nadvantages of the conquests we have already made by having voluntarily\nabandoned them. To hold such a line successfully and in security it is far\nfrom being certain that it would not require as large an army as would be\nnecessary to hold all the conquests we have already made and to continue\nthe prosecution of the war in the heart of the enemy\'s country. It is also\nfar from being certain that the expenses of the war would be diminished by\nsuch a policy. I am persuaded that the best means of vindicating the\nnational honor and interest and of bringing the war to an honorable close\nwill be to prosecute it with increased energy and power in the vital parts\nof the enemy\'s country.</p>\n\n<p>In my annual message to Congress of December last I declared that--</p>\n\n<p>The war has not been waged with a view to conquest, but, having been\ncommenced by Mexico, it has been carried into the enemy\'s country and will\nbe vigorously prosecuted there with a view to obtain an honorable peace,\nand thereby secure ample indemnity for the expenses of the war, as well as\nto our much-injured citizens, who hold large pecuniary demands against\nMexico.</p>\n\n<p>Such, in my judgment, continues to be our true policy; indeed, the only\npolicy which will probably secure a permanent peace.</p>\n\n<p>It has never been contemplated by me, as an object of the war, to make a\npermanent conquest of the Republic of Mexico or to annihilate her separate\nexistence as an independent nation. On the contrary, it has ever been my\ndesire that she should maintain her nationality, and under a good\ngovernment adapted to her condition be a free, independent, and prosperous\nRepublic. The United States were the first among the nations to recognize\nher independence, and have always desired to be on terms of amity and good\nneighborhood with her. This she would not suffer. By her own conduct we\nhave been compelled to engage in the present war. In its prosecution we\nseek not her overthrow as a nation, but in vindicating our national honor\nwe seek to obtain redress for the wrongs she has done us and indemnity for\nour just demands against her. We demand an honorable peace, and that peace\nmust bring with it indemnity for the past and security for the future.\nHitherto Mexico has refused all accommodation by which such a peace could\nbe obtained.</p>\n\n<p>Whilst our armies have advanced from victory to victory from the\ncommencement of the war, it has always been with the olive branch of peace\nin their hands, and it has been in the power of Mexico at every step to\narrest hostilities by accepting it.</p>\n\n<p>One great obstacle to the attainment of peace has undoubtedly arisen from\nthe fact that Mexico has been so long held in subjection by one faction or\nmilitary usurper after another, and such has been the condition of\ninsecurity in which their successive governments have been placed that each\nhas been deterred from making peace lest for this very cause a rival\nfaction might expel it from power. Such was the fate of President Herrera\'s\nadministration in 1845 for being disposed even to listen to the overtures\nof the United States to prevent the war, as is fully confirmed by an\nofficial correspondence which took place in the month of August last\nbetween him and his Government, a copy of which is herewith communicated.\n"For this cause alone the revolution which displaced him from power was set\non foot" by General Paredes. Such may be the condition of insecurity of the\npresent Government.</p>\n\n<p>There can be no doubt that the peaceable and well-disposed inhabitants of\nMexico are convinced that it is the true interest of their country to\nconclude an honorable peace with the United States, but the apprehension of\nbecoming the victims of some military faction or usurper may have prevented\nthem from manifesting their feelings by any public act. The removal of any\nsuch apprehension would probably cause them to speak their sentiments\nfreely and to adopt the measures necessary for the restoration of peace.\nWith a people distracted and divided by contending factions and a\nGovernment subject to constant changes by successive revolutions, the\ncontinued successes of our arms may fail to secure a satisfactory peace. In\nsuch event it may become proper for our commanding generals in the field to\ngive encouragement and assurances of protection to the friends of peace in\nMexico in the establishment and maintenance of a free republican government\nof their own choice, able and willing to conclude a peace which would be\njust to them and secure to us the indemnity we demand. This may become the\nonly mode of obtaining such a peace. Should such be the result, the war\nwhich Mexico has forced upon us would thus be converted into an enduring\nblessing to herself. After finding her torn and distracted by factions, and\nruled by military usurpers, we should then leave her with a republican\ngovernment in the enjoyment of real independence and domestic peace and\nprosperity, performing all her relative duties in the great family of\nnations and promoting her own happiness by wise laws and their faithful\nexecution.</p>\n\n<p>If, after affording this encouragement and protection, and after all the\npersevering and sincere efforts we have made from the moment Mexico\ncommenced the war, and prior to that time, to adjust our differences with\nher, we shall ultimately fail, then we shall have exhausted all honorable\nmeans in pursuit of peace, and must continue to occupy her country with our\ntroops, taking the full measure of indemnity into our own hands, and must\nenforce the terms which our honor demands.</p>\n\n<p>To act otherwise in the existing state of things in Mexico, and to withdraw\nour Army without a peace, would not only leave all the wrongs of which we\ncomplain unredressed, but would be the signal for new and fierce civil\ndissensions and new revolutions--all alike hostile to peaceful relations\nwith the United States. Besides, there is danger, if our troops were\nwithdrawn before a peace was conducted, that the Mexican people, wearied\nwith successive revolutions and deprived of protection for their persons\nand property, might at length be inclined to yield to foreign influences\nand to cast themselves into the arms of some European monarch for\nprotection from the anarchy and suffering which would ensue. This, for our\nown safety and in pursuance of our established policy, we should be\ncompelled to resist. We could never consent that Mexico should be thus\nconverted into a monarchy governed by a foreign prince.</p>\n\n<p>Mexico is our near neighbor, and her boundaries are coterminous with our\nown through the whole extent across the North American continent, from\nocean to ocean. Both politically and commercially we have the deepest\ninterest in her regeneration and prosperity. Indeed, it is impossible that,\nwith any just regard to our own safety, we can ever become indifferent to\nher fate.</p>\n\n<p>It may be that the Mexican Government and people have misconstrued or\nmisunderstood our forbearance and our objects in desiring to conclude an\namicable adjustment of the existing differences between the two countries.\nThey may have supposed that we would submit to terms degrading to the\nnation, or they may have drawn false inferences from the supposed division\nof opinion in the United States on the subject of the war, and may have\ncalculated to gain much by protracting it, and, indeed, that we might\nultimately abandon it altogether without insisting on any indemnity,\nterritorial or otherwise. Whatever may be the false impressions under which\nthey have acted, the adoption and prosecution of the energetic policy\nproposed must soon undeceive them.</p>\n\n<p>In the future prosecution of the war the enemy must be made to feel its\npressure more than they have heretofore done. At its commencement it was\ndeemed proper to conduct it in a spirit of forbearance and liberality. With\nthis end in view, early measures were adopted to conciliate, as far as a\nstate of war would permit, the mass of the Mexican population; to convince\nthem that the war was waged, not against the peaceful inhabitants of\nMexico, but against their faithless Government, which had commenced\nhostilities; to remove from their minds the false impressions which their\ndesigning and interested rulers had artfully attempted to make, that the\nwar on our part was one of conquest, that it was a war against their\nreligion and their churches, which were to be desecrated and overthrown,\nand that their rights of person and private property would be violated. To\nremove these false impressions, our commanders in the field were directed\nscrupulously to respect their religion, their churches, and their church\nproperty, which were in no manner to be violated; they were directed also\nto respect the rights of persons and property of all who should not take up\narms against us.</p>\n\n<p>Assurances to this effect were given to the Mexican people by Major General\nTaylor in a proclamation issued in pursuance of instructions from the\nSecretary of War in the month of June, 1846, and again by Major-General\nScott, who acted upon his own convictions of the propriety of issuing it,\nin a proclamation of the 11th of May, 1847. In this spirit of liberality\nand conciliation, and with a view to prevent the body of the Mexican\npopulation from taking up arms against us, was the war conducted on our\npart. Provisions and other supplies furnished to our Army by Mexican\ncitizens were paid for at fair and liberal prices, agreed upon by the\nparties. After the lapse of a few months it became apparent that these\nassurances and this mild treatment had failed to produce the desired effect\nupon the Mexican population. While the war had been conducted on our part\naccording to the most humane and liberal principles observed by civilized\nnations, it was waged in a far different spirit on the part of Mexico. Not\nappreciating our forbearance, the Mexican people generally became hostile\nto the United States, and availed themselves of every opportunity to commit\nthe most savage excesses upon our troops. Large numbers of the population\ntook up arms, and, engaging in guerrilla warfare, robbed and murdered in\nthe most cruel manner individual soldiers or small parties whom accident or\nother causes had separated from the main body of our Army; bands of\nguerrilleros and robbers infested the roads, harassed our trains, and\nwhenever it was in their power cut off our supplies.</p>\n\n<p>The Mexicans having thus shown themselves to be wholly incapable of\nappreciating our forbearance and liberality, it was deemed proper to change\nthe manner of conducting the war, by making them feel its pressure\naccording to the usages observed under similar circumstances by all other\ncivilized nations.</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, as early as the 22d of September, 1846, instructions were\ngiven by the Secretary of War to Major-General Taylor to "draw supplies"\nfor our Army "from the enemy without paying for them, and to require\ncontributions for its support, if in that way he was satisfied he could get\nabundant supplies for his forces." In directing the execution of these\ninstructions much was necessarily left to the discretion of the commanding\nofficer, who was best acquainted with the circumstances by which he was\nsurrounded, the wants of the Army, and the practicability of enforcing the\nmeasure. General Taylor, on the 26th of October, 1846, replied from\nMonterey that "it would have been impossible hitherto, and is so now, to\nsustain the Army to any extent by forced contributions of money or\nsupplies." For the reasons assigned by him, he did not adopt the policy of\nhis instructions, but declared his readiness to do so "should the Army in\nits future operations reach a portion of the country which may be made to\nsupply the troops with advantage." He continued to pay for the articles of\nsupply which were drawn from the enemy\'s country.</p>\n\n<p>Similar instructions were issued to Major-General Scott on the 3d of April,\n1847, who replied from Jalapa on the 20th of May, 1847, that if it be\nexpected "that the Army is to support itself by forced contributions levied\nupon the country we may ruin and exasperate the inhabitants and starve\nourselves." The same discretion was given to him that had been to General\nTaylor in this respect. General Scott, for the reasons assigned by him,\nalso continued to pay for the articles of supply for the Army which were\ndrawn from the enemy.</p>\n\n<p>After the Army had reached the heart of the most wealthy portion of Mexico\nit was supposed that the obstacles which had before that time prevented it\nwould not be such as to render impracticable the levy of forced\ncontributions for its support, and on the 1st of September and again on the\n6th of October, 1847, the order was repeated in dispatches addressed by the\nSecretary of War to General Scott, and his attention was again called to\nthe importance of making the enemy bear the burdens of the war by requiring\nthem to furnish the means of supporting our Army, and he was directed to\nadopt this policy unless by doing so there was danger of depriving the Army\nof the necessary supplies. Copies of these dispatches were forwarded to\nGeneral Taylor for his government.</p>\n\n<p>On the 31st of March last I caused an order to be issued to our military\nand naval commanders to levy and collect a military contribution upon all\nvessels and merchandise which might enter any of the ports of Mexico in our\nmilitary occupation, and to apply such contributions toward defraying the\nexpenses of the war. By virtue of the right of conquest and the laws of\nwar, the conqueror, consulting his own safety or convenience, may either\nexclude foreign commerce altogether from all such ports or permit it upon\nsuch terms and conditions as he may prescribe. Before the principal ports\nof Mexico were blockaded by our Navy the revenue derived from import duties\nunder the laws of Mexico was paid into the Mexican treasury. After these\nports had fallen into our military possession the blockade was raised and\ncommerce with them permitted upon prescribed terms and conditions. They\nwere opened to the trade of all nations upon the payment of duties more\nmoderate in their amount than those which had been previously levied by\nMexico, and the revenue, which was formerly paid into the Mexican treasury,\nwas directed to be collected by our military and naval officers and applied\nto the use of our Army and Navy. Care was taken that the officers,\nsoldiers, and sailors of our Army and Navy should be exempted from the\noperations of the order, and, as the merchandise imported upon which the\norder operated must be consumed by Mexican citizens, the contributions\nexacted were in effect the seizure of the public revenues of Mexico and the\napplication of them to our own use. In directing this measure the object\nwas to compel the enemy to contribute as far as practicable toward the\nexpenses of the war.</p>\n\n<p>For the amount of contributions which have been levied in this form I refer\nyou to the accompanying reports of the Secretary of War and of the\nSecretary of the Navy, by which it appears that a sum exceeding half a\nmillion of dollars has been collected. This amount would undoubtedly have\nbeen much larger but for the difficulty of keeping open communications\nbetween the coast and the interior, so as to enable the owners of the\nmerchandise imported to transport and vend it to the inhabitants of the\ncountry. It is confidently expected that this difficulty will to a great\nextent be soon removed by our increased forces which have been sent to the\nfield.</p>\n\n<p>Measures have recently been adopted by which the internal as well as the\nexternal revenues of Mexico in all places in our military occupation will\nbe seized and appropriated to the use of our Army and Navy.</p>\n\n<p>The policy of levying upon the enemy contributions in every form\nconsistently with the laws of nations, which it may be practicable for our\nmilitary commanders to adopt, should, in my judgment, be rigidly enforced,\nand orders to this effect have accordingly been given. By such a policy, at\nthe same time that our own Treasury will be relieved from a heavy drain,\nthe Mexican people will be made to feel the burdens of the war, and,\nconsulting their own interests, may be induced the more readily to require\ntheir rulers to accede to a just peace.</p>\n\n<p>After the adjournment of the last session of Congress events transpired in\nthe prosecution of the war which in my judgment required a greater number\nof troops in the field than had been anticipated. The strength of the Army\nwas accordingly increased by "accepting" the services of all the volunteer\nforces authorized by the act of the 13th of May, 1846, without putting a\nconstruction on that act the correctness of which was seriously questioned.\nThe volunteer forces now in the field, with those which had been "accepted"\nto "serve for twelve months" and were discharged at the end of their term\nof service, exhaust the 50,000 men authorized by that act. Had it been\nclear that a proper construction of the act warranted it, the services of\nan additional number would have been called for and accepted; but doubts\nexisting upon this point, the power was not exercised. It is deemed\nimportant that Congress should at an early period of their session confer\nthe authority to raise an additional regular force to serve during the war\nwith Mexico and to be discharged upon the conclusion and ratification of a\ntreaty of peace. I invite the attention of Congress to the views presented\nby the Secretary of War in his report upon this subject.</p>\n\n<p>I recommend also that authority be given by law to call for and accept the\nservices of an additional number of volunteers, to be exercised at such\ntime and to such extent as the emergencies of the service may require.</p>\n\n<p>In prosecuting the war with Mexico, whilst the utmost care has been taken\nto avoid every just cause of complaint on the part of neutral nations, and\nnone has been given, liberal privileges have been granted to their commerce\nin the ports of the enemy in our military occupation. The difficulty with\nthe Brazilian Government, which at one time threatened to interrupt the\nfriendly relations between the two countries, will, I trust, be speedily\nadjusted. I have received information that an envoy extraordinary and\nminister plenipotentiary to the United States will shortly be appointed by\nHis Imperial Majesty, and it is hoped that he will come instructed and\nprepared to adjust all remaining differences between the two Governments in\na manner acceptable and honorable to both. In the meantime, I have every\nreason to believe that nothing will occur to interrupt our amicable\nrelations with Brazil.</p>\n\n<p>It has been my constant effort to maintain and cultivate the most intimate\nrelations of friendship with all the independent powers of South America,\nand this policy has been attended with the happiest results. It is true\nthat the settlement and payment of many just claims of American citizens\nagainst these nations have been long delayed. The peculiar position in\nwhich they have been placed and the desire on the part of my predecessors\nas well as myself to grant them the utmost indulgence have hitherto\nprevented these claims from being urged in a manner demanded by strict\njustice. The time has arrived when they ought to be finally adjusted and\nliquidated, and efforts are now making for that purpose.</p>\n\n<p>It is proper to inform you that the Government of Peru has in good faith\npaid the first two installments of the indemnity of $30,000 each, and the\ngreater portion of the interest due thereon, in execution of the convention\nbetween that Government and the United States the ratifications of which\nwere exchanged at Lima on the 31st of October, 1846. The Attorney-General\nof the United States early in August last completed the adjudication of the\nclaims under this convention, and made his report thereon in pursuance of\nthe act of the 8th of August, 1846. The sums to which the claimants are\nrespectively entitled will be paid on demand at the Treasury.</p>\n\n<p>I invite the early attention of Congress to the present condition of our\ncitizens in China. Under our treaty with that power American citizens are\nwithdrawn from the jurisdiction, whether civil or criminal, of the Chinese\nGovernment and placed under that of our public functionaries in that\ncountry. By these alone can our citizens be tried and punished for the\ncommission of any crime; by these alone can questions be decided between\nthem involving the rights of persons and property, and by these alone can\ncontracts be enforced into which they may have entered with the citizens or\nsubjects of foreign powers. The merchant vessels of the United States lying\nin the waters of the five ports of China open to foreign commerce are under\nthe exclusive jurisdiction of officers of their own Government. Until\nCongress shall establish competent tribunals to try and punish crimes and\nto exercise jurisdiction in civil cases in China, American citizens there\nare subject to no law whatever. Crimes may be committed with impunity and\ndebts may be contracted without any means to enforce their payment.\nInconveniences have already resulted from the omission of Congress to\nlegislate upon the subject, and still greater are apprehended. The British\nauthorities in China have already complained that this Government has not\nprovided for the punishment of crimes or the enforcement of contracts\nagainst American citizens in that country, whilst their Government has\nestablished tribunals by which an American citizen can recover debts due\nfrom British subjects. Accustomed, as the Chinese are, to summary justice,\nthey could not be made to comprehend why criminals who are citizens of the\nUnited States should escape with impunity, in violation of treaty\nobligations, whilst the punishment of a Chinese who had committed any crime\nagainst an American citizen would be rigorously exacted. Indeed, the\nconsequences might be fatal to American citizens in China should a flagrant\ncrime be committed by any one of them upon a Chinese, and should trial and\npunishment not follow according to the requisitions of the treaty. This\nmight disturb, if not destroy, our friendly relations with that Empire, and\ncause an interruption of our valuable commerce. Our treaties with the\nSublime Porte, Tripoli, Tunis, Morocco, and Muscat also require the\nlegislation of Congress to carry them into execution, though the necessity\nfor immediate action may not be so urgent as in regard to China.</p>\n\n<p>The Secretary of State has submitted an estimate to defray the expense of\nopening diplomatic relations with the Papal States. The interesting\npolitical events now in progress in these States, as well as a just regard\nto our commercial interests, have, in my opinion, rendered such a measure\nhighly expedient.</p>\n\n<p>Estimates have also been submitted for the outfits and salaries of charges\'\nd\'affaires to the Republics of Bolivia, Guatemala, and Ecuador. The\nmanifest importance of cultivating the most friendly relations with all the\nindependent States upon this continent has induced me to recommend\nappropriations necessary for the maintenance of these missions.</p>\n\n<p>I recommend to Congress that an appropriation be made to be paid to the\nSpanish Government for the purpose of distribution among the claimants in\nthe Amistad case. I entertain the conviction that this is due to Spain\nunder the treaty of the 20th of October, 1795, and, moreover, that from the\nearnest manner in which the claim continues to be urged so long as it shall\nremain unsettled it will be a source of irritation and discord between the\ntwo countries, which may prove highly prejudicial to the interests of the\nUnited States. Good policy, no less than a faithful compliance with our\ntreaty obligations, requires that the inconsiderable appropriation demanded\nshould be made.</p>\n\n<p>A detailed statement of the condition of the finances will be presented in\nthe annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury. The imports for the\nlast fiscal year, ending on the 30th of June, 1847, were of the value of\n$146,545,638, of which the amount exported was $8,011,158, leaving\n$138,534,480 in the country for domestic use. The value of the exports for\nthe same period was $158,648,622, of which $150,637,464 consisted of\ndomestic productions and $8,011,158 of foreign articles.</p>\n\n<p>The receipts into the Treasury for the same period amounted to\n$26,346,790.37, of which there was derived from customs $23,747,864.66,\nfrom sales of public lands $2,498,335.20, and from incidental and\nmiscellaneous sources $100,570.51. The last fiscal year, during which this\namount was received, embraced five months under the operation of the tariff\nact of 1842 and seven months during which the tariff act of 1846 was in\nforce. During the five months under the act of 1842 the amount received\nfrom customs was $7,842,306.90, and during the seven months under the act\nof 1846 the amount received was $15,905,557.76.</p>\n\n<p>The net revenue from customs during the year ending on the 1st of December,\n1846, being the last year under the operation of the tariff act of 1842,\nwas $22,971,403.10, and the net revenue from customs during the year ending\non the 1st of December, 1847, being the first year under the operations of\nthe tariff act of 1846, was about $31,500,000, being an increase of revenue\nfor the first year under the tariff of 1846 of more than $8,500,000 over\nthat of the last year under the tariff of 1842.</p>\n\n<p>The expenditures during the fiscal year ending on the 30th of June last\nwere $59,451,177.65, of which $3,522,082.37 was on account payment of\nprincipal and interest of the public debt, including Treasury notes\nredeemed and not funded. The expenditures exclusive of payment of public\ndebt were $55,929,095.28.</p>\n\n<p>It is estimated that the receipts into the Treasury for the fiscal year\nending on the 30th of June, 1848, including the balance in the Treasury on\nthe 1st of July last, will amount to $42,886,545.80, of which $31,000,000,\nit is estimated, will be derived from customs, $3,500,000 from the sale of\nthe public lands, $400,000 from incidental sources, eluding sales made by\nthe Solicitor of the Treasury, and $6,285,294.55 from loans already\nauthorized by law, which, together with the balance in the Treasury on the\n1st of July last, make the sum estimated.</p>\n\n<p>The expenditures for the same period, if peace with Mexico shall not be\nconcluded and the Army shall be increased as is proposed, will amount,\nincluding the necessary payments on account of principal and interest of\nthe public debt and Treasury notes, to $58,615,660.07. On the 1st of the\npresent month the amount of the public debt actually incurred, including\nTreasury notes, was $45,659,659.40. The public debt due on the 4th of\nMarch, 1845, including Treasury notes, was $17,788,799.62, and consequently\nthe addition made to the public debt since that time is $27,870,859.78.</p>\n\n<p>Of the loan of twenty-three millions authorized by the act of the 28th of\nJanuary, 1847, the sum of five millions was paid out to the public\ncreditors or exchanged at par for specie; the remaining eighteen millions\nwas offered for specie to the highest bidder not below par, by an\nadvertisement issued by the Secretary of the Treasury and published from\nthe 9th of February until the 10th of April, 1847, when it was awarded to\nthe several highest bidders at premiums varying from one-eighth of per cent\nto 2 per cent above par. The premium has been paid into the Treasury and\nthe sums awarded deposited in specie in the Treasury as fast as it was\nrequired by the wants of the Government.</p>\n\n<p>To meet the expenditures for the remainder of the present and for the next\nfiscal year, ending on the 30th of June, 1849, a further loan in aid of the\nordinary revenues of the Government will be necessary. Retaining a\nsufficient surplus in the Treasury, the loan required for the remainder of\nthe present fiscal year will be about $18,500,000. If the duty on tea and\ncoffee be imposed and the graduation of the price of the public lands shall\nbe made at an early period of your session, as recommended, the loan for\nthe present fiscal year may be reduced to $17,000,000. The loan may be\nfurther reduced by whatever amount of expenditures can be saved by military\ncontributions collected in Mexico. The most vigorous measures for the\naugmentation of these contributions have been directed and a very\nconsiderable sum is expected from that source. Its amount can not, however,\nbe calculated with any certainty. It is recommended that the loan to be\nmade be authorized upon the same terms and for the same time as that which\nwas authorized under the provisions of the act of the 28th of January,\n1847.</p>\n\n<p>Should the war with Mexico be continued until the 30th of June, 1849, it is\nestimated that a further loan of $20,500,000 will be required for the\nfiscal year ending on that day, in case no duty be imposed on tea and\ncoffee, and the public lands be not reduced and graduated in price, and no\nmilitary contributions shall be collected in Mexico. If the duty on tea and\ncoffee be imposed and the lands be reduced and graduated in price as\nproposed, the loan may be reduced to $17,000,000, and will be subject to be\nstill further reduced by the amount of the military contributions which may\nbe collected in Mexico. It is not proposed, however, at present to ask\nCongress for authority to negotiate this loan for the next fiscal year, as\nit is hoped that the loan asked for the remainder of the present fiscal\nyear, aided by military contributions which may be collected in Mexico, may\nbe sufficient. If, contrary to my expectation, there should be a necessity\nfor it, the fact will be communicated to Congress in time for their action\nduring the present session. In no event will a sum exceeding $6,000,000 of\nthis amount be needed before the meeting of the session of Congress in\nDecember, 1848.</p>\n\n<p>The act of the 30th of July, 1846, "reducing the duties on imports," has\nbeen in force since the 1st of December last, and I am gratified to state\nthat all the beneficial effects which were anticipated from its operation\nhave been fully realized. The public revenue derived from customs during\nthe year ending on the 1st of December, 1847, exceeds by more than\n$8,000,000 the amount received in the preceding year under the operation of\nthe act of 1842, which was superseded and repealed by it. Its effects are\nvisible in the great and almost unexampled prosperity which prevails in\nevery branch of business.</p>\n\n<p>While the repeal of the prohibitory and restrictive duties of the act of\n1842 and the substitution in their place of reasonable revenue rates levied\non articles imported according to their actual value has increased the\nrevenue and augmented our foreign trade, all the great interests of the\ncountry have been advanced and promoted.</p>\n\n<p>The great and important interests of agriculture, which had been not only\ntoo much neglected, but actually taxed under the protective policy for the\nbenefit of other interests, have been relieved of the burdens which that\npolicy imposed on them; and our farmers and planters, under a more just and\nliberal commercial policy, are finding new and profitable markets abroad\nfor their augmented products. Our commerce is rapidly increasing, and is\nextending more widely the circle of international exchanges. Great as has\nbeen the increase of our imports during the past year, our exports of\ndomestic products sold in foreign markets have been still greater.</p>\n\n<p>Our navigating interest is eminently prosperous. The number of vessels\nbuilt in the United States has been greater than during any preceding\nperiod of equal length. Large profits have been derived by those who have\nconstructed as well as by those who have navigated them. Should the ratio\nof increase in the number of our merchant vessels be progressive, and be as\ngreat for the future as during the past year, the time is not distant when\nour tonnage and commercial marine will be larger than that of any other\nnation in the world.</p>\n\n<p>Whilst the interests of agriculture, of commerce, and of navigation have\nbeen enlarged and invigorated, it is highly gratifying to observe that our\nmanufactures are also in a prosperous condition. None of the ruinous\neffects upon this interest which were apprehended by some as the result of\nthe operation of the revenue system established by the act of 1846 have\nbeen experienced. On the contrary, the number of manufactories and the\namount of capital invested in them is steadily and rapidly increasing,\naffording gratifying proofs that American enterprise and skill employed in\nthis branch of domestic industry, with no other advantages than those\nfairly and incidentally accruing from a just System of revenue duties, are\nabundantly able to meet successfully all competition from abroad and still\nderive fair and remunerating profits. While capital invested in\nmanufactures is yielding adequate and fair profits under the new system,\nthe wages of labor, whether employed in manufactures, agriculture,\ncommerce, or navigation, have been augmented. The toiling millions whose\ndaily labor furnishes the supply of food and raiment and all the\nnecessaries and comforts of life are receiving higher wages and more steady\nand permanent employment than in any other country or at any previous\nperiod of our own history.</p>\n\n<p>So successful have been all branches of our industry that a foreign war,\nwhich generally diminishes the resources of a nation, has in no essential\ndegree retarded our onward progress or checked our general prosperity.</p>\n\n<p>With such gratifying evidences of prosperity and of the successful\noperation of the revenue act of 1846, every consideration of public policy\nrecommends that it shall remain unchanged. It is hoped that the system of\nimpost duties which it established may be regarded as the permanent policy\nof the country, and that the great interests affected by it may not again\nbe subject to be injuriously disturbed, as they have heretofore been by\nfrequent and sometimes sudden changes.</p>\n\n<p>For the purpose of increasing the revenue, and without changing or\nmodifying the rates imposed by the act of 1846 on the dutiable articles\nembraced by its provisions, I again recommend to your favorable\nconsideration the expediency of levying a revenue duty on tea and coffee.\nThe policy which exempted these articles from duty during peace, and when\nthe revenue to be derived from them was not needed, ceases to exist when\nthe country is engaged in war and requires the use of all of its available\nresources. It is a tax which would be so generally diffused among the\npeople that it would be felt oppressively by none and be complained of by\nnone. It is believed that there are not in the list of imported articles\nany which are more properly the subject of war duties than tea and coffee.</p>\n\n<p>It is estimated that $3,000,000 would be derived annually by a moderate\nduty imposed on these articles.</p>\n\n<p>Should Congress avail itself of this additional source of revenue, not only\nwould the amount of the public loan rendered necessary by the war with\nMexico be diminished to that extent, but the public credit and the public\nconfidence in the ability and determination of the Government to meet all\nits engagements promptly would be more firmly established, and the reduced\namount of the loan which it may be necessary to negotiate could probably be\nobtained at cheaper rates.</p>\n\n<p>Congress is therefore called upon to determine whether it is wiser to\nimpose the war duties recommended or by omitting to do so increase the\npublic debt annually $3,000,000 so long as loans shall be required to\nprosecute the war, and afterwards provide in some other form to pay the\nsemiannual interest upon it, and ultimately to extinguish the principal. If\nin addition to these duties Congress should graduate and reduce the price\nof such of the public lands as experience has proved will not command the\nprice placed upon them by the Government, an additional annual income to\nthe Treasury of between half a million and a million of dollars, it is\nestimated, would be derived from this source. Should both measures receive\nthe sanction of Congress, the annual amount of public debt necessary to be\ncontracted during the continuance of the war would be reduced near\n$4,000,000. The duties recommended to be levied on tea and coffee it is\nproposed shall be limited in their duration to the end of the war, and\nuntil the public debt rendered necessary to be contracted by it shall be\ndischarged. The amount of the public debt to be contracted should be\nlimited to the lowest practicable sum, and should be extinguished as early\nafter the conclusion of the war as the means of the Treasury will permit.</p>\n\n<p>With this view, it is recommended that as soon as the war shall be over all\nthe surplus in the Treasury not needed for other indispensable objects\nshall constitute a sinking fund and be applied to the purchase of the\nfunded debt, and that authority be conferred by laws for that purpose. The\nact of the 6th of August, 1846, "to establish a warehousing system," has\nbeen in operation more than a year, and has proved to be an important\nauxiliary to the tariff act of 1846 in augmenting the revenue and extending\nthe commerce of the country. Whilst it has tended to enlarge commerce, it\nhas been beneficial to our manufactures by diminishing forced sales at\nauction of foreign goods at low prices to raise the duties to be advanced\non them, and by checking fluctuations in the market. The system, although\nsanctioned by the experience of other countries, was entirely new in the\nUnited States, and is susceptible of improvement in some of its provisions.\nThe Secretary of the Treasury, upon whom was devolved large discretionary\npowers in carrying this measure into effect, has collected and is now\ncollating the practical results of the system in other countries where it\nhas long been established, and will report at an early period of your\nsession such further regulations suggested by the investigation as may\nrender it still more effective and beneficial.</p>\n\n<p>By the act to "provide for the better organization of the Treasury and for\nthe collection, safe-keeping, and disbursement of the public revenue" all\nbanks were discontinued as fiscal agents of the Government, and the paper\ncurrency issued by them was no longer permitted to be received in payment\nof public dues. The constitutional treasury created by this act went into\noperation on the 1st of January last. Under the system established by it\nthe public moneys have been collected, safely kept, and disbursed by the\ndirect agency of officers of the Government in gold and silver, and\ntransfers of large amounts have been made from points of collection to\npoints of disbursement without loss to the Treasury or injury or\ninconvenience to the trade of the country.</p>\n\n<p>While the fiscal operations of the Government have been conducted with\nregularity and ease under this system, it has had a salutary effect in\nchecking and preventing an undue inflation of the paper currency issued by\nthe banks which exist under State charters. Requiring, as it does, all dues\nto the Government to be paid in gold and silver, its effect is to restrain\nexcessive issues of bank paper by the banks disproportioned to the specie\nin their vaults, for the reason that they are at all times liable to be\ncalled on by the holders of their notes for their redemption in order to\nobtain specie for the payment of duties and other public dues. The banks,\ntherefore, must keep their business within prudent limits, and be always in\na condition to meet such calls, or run the hazard of being compelled to\nsuspend specie payments and be thereby discredited. The amount of specie\nimported into the United States during the last fiscal year was\n$24,121,289, of which there was retained in the country $22,276,170. Had\nthe former financial system prevailed and the public moneys been placed on\ndeposit in the banks, nearly the whole of this amount would have gone into\ntheir vaults, not to be thrown into circulation by them, but to be withheld\nfrom the hands of the people as a currency and made the basis of new and\nenormous issues of bank paper. A large proportion of the specie imported\nhas been paid into the Treasury for public dues, and after having been to a\ngreat extent recoined at the Mint has been paid out to the public creditors\nand gone into circulation as a currency among the people. The amount of\ngold and silver coin now in circulation in the country is larger than at\nany former period.</p>\n\n<p>The financial system established by the constitutional treasury has been\nthus far eminently successful in its operations, and I recommend an\nadherence to all its essential provisions, and especially to that vital\nprovision which wholly separates the Government from all connection with\nbanks and excludes bank paper from all revenue receipts.</p>\n\n<p>In some of its details, not involving its general principles, the system is\ndefective and will require modification. These defects and such amendments\nas are deemed important were set forth in the last annual report of the\nSecretary of the Treasury. These amendments are again recommended to the\nearly and favorable consideration of Congress.</p>\n\n<p>During the past year the coinage at the Mint and its branches has exceeded\n$20,000,000. This has consisted chiefly in converting the coins of foreign\ncountries into American coin.</p>\n\n<p>The largest amount of foreign coin imported has been received at New York,\nand if a branch mint were established at that city all the foreign coin\nreceived at that port could at once be converted into our own coin without\nthe expense, risk, and delay of transporting it to the Mint for that\npurpose, and the amount recoined would be much larger.</p>\n\n<p>Experience has proved that foreign coin, and especially foreign gold coin,\nwill not circulate extensively as a currency among the people. The\nimportant measure of extending our specie circulation, both of gold and\nsilver, and of diffusing it among the people can only be effected by\nconverting such foreign coin into American coin. I repeat the\nrecommendation contained in my last annual message for the establishment of\na branch of the Mint of the United States at the city of New York.</p>\n\n<p>All the public lands which had been surveyed and were ready for market have\nbeen proclaimed for sale during the past year. The quantity offered and to\nbe offered for sale under proclamations issued since the 1st of January\nlast amounts to 9,138,531 acres. The prosperity of the Western States and\nTerritories in which these lands lie will be advanced by their speedy sale.\nBy withholding them from market their growth and increase of population\nwould be retarded, while thousands of our enterprising and meritorious\nfrontier population would be deprived of the opportunity of securing\nfreeholds for themselves and their families. But in addition to the general\nconsiderations which rendered the early sale of these lands proper, it was\na leading object at this time to derive as large a sum as possible from\nthis source, and thus diminish by that amount the public loan rendered\nnecessary by the existence of a foreign war.</p>\n\n<p>It is estimated that not less than 10,000,000 acres of the public lands\nwill be surveyed and be in a condition to be proclaimed for sale during the\nyear 1848.</p>\n\n<p>In my last annual message I presented the reasons which in my judgment\nrendered it proper to graduate and reduce the price of such of the public\nlands as have remained unsold for long periods after they had been offered\nfor sale at public auction.</p>\n\n<p>Many millions of acres of public lands lying within the limits of several\nof the Western States have been offered in the market and been subject to\nsale at private entry for more than twenty years and large quantities for\nmore than thirty years at the lowest price prescribed by the existing laws,\nand it has been found that they will not command that price. They must\nremain unsold and uncultivated for an indefinite period unless the price\ndemanded for them by the Government shall be reduced. No satisfactory\nreason is perceived why they should be longer held at rates above their\nreal value. At the present period an additional reason exists for adopting\nthe measure recommended. When the country is engaged in a foreign war, and\nwe must necessarily resort to loans, it would seem to be the dictate of\nwisdom that we should avail ourselves of all our resources and thus limit\nthe amount of the public indebtedness to the lowest possible sum.</p>\n\n<p>I recommend that the existing laws on the subject of preemption rights be\namended and modified so as to operate prospectively and to embrace all who\nmay settle upon the public lands and make improvements upon them, before\nthey are surveyed as well as afterwards, in all cases where such\nsettlements may be made after the Indian title shall have been\nextinguished.</p>\n\n<p>If the right of preemption be thus extended, it will embrace a large and\nmeritorious class of our citizens. It will increase the number of small\nfreeholders upon our borders, who will be enabled thereby to educate their\nchildren and otherwise improve their condition, while they will be found at\nall times, as they have ever proved themselves to be in the hour of danger\nto their country, among our hardiest and best volunteer soldiers, ever\nready to attend to their services in cases of emergencies and among the\nlast to leave the field as long as an enemy remains to be encountered. Such\na policy will also impress these patriotic pioneer emigrants with deeper\nfeelings of gratitude for the parental care of their Government, when they\nfind their dearest interests secured to them by the permanent laws of the\nland and that they are no longer in danger of losing their homes and\nhard-earned improvements by being brought into competition with a more\nwealthy class of purchasers at the land sales. The attention of Congress\nwas invited at their last and the preceding session to the importance of\nestablishing a Territorial government over our possessions in Oregon, and\nit is to be regretted that there was no legislation on the subject. Our\ncitizens who inhabit that distant region of country are still left without\nthe protection of our laws, or any regularly organized government. Before\nthe question of limits and boundaries of the Territory of Oregon was\ndefinitely settled, from the necessity of their condition the inhabitants\nhad established a temporary government of their own. Besides the want of\nlegal authority for continuing such a government, it is wholly inadequate\nto protect them in their rights of person and property, or to secure to\nthem the enjoyment of the privileges of other citizens, to which they are\nentitled under the Constitution of the United States. They should have the\nright of suffrage, be represented in a Territorial legislature and by a\nDelegate in Congress, and possess all the rights and privileges which\ncitizens of other portions of the territories of the United States have\nheretofore enjoyed or may now enjoy.</p>\n\n<p>Our judicial system, revenue laws, laws regulating trade and intercourse\nwith the Indian tribes, and the protection of our laws generally should be\nextended over them.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the inhabitants in that Territory who had previously\nemigrated to it, large numbers of our citizens have followed them during\nthe present year, and it is not doubted that during the next and subsequent\nyears their numbers will be greatly increased.</p>\n\n<p>Congress at its last session established post routes leading to Oregon, and\nbetween different points within that Territory, and authorized the\nestablishment of post-offices at "Astoria and such other places on the\ncoasts of the Pacific within the territory of the United States as the\npublic interests may require." Post-offices have accordingly been\nestablished, deputy postmasters appointed, and provision made for the\ntransportation of the mails.</p>\n\n<p>The preservation of peace with the Indian tribes residing west of the Rocky\nMountains will render it proper that authority should be given by law for\nthe appointment of an adequate number of Indian agents to reside among\nthem.</p>\n\n<p>I recommend that a surveyor-general\'s office be established in that\nTerritory, and that the public lands be surveyed and brought into market at\nan early period.</p>\n\n<p>I recommend also that grants, upon liberal terms, of limited quantities of\nthe public lands be made to all citizens of the United States who have\nemigrated, or may hereafter within a prescribed period emigrate, to Oregon\nand settle upon them. These hardy and adventurous citizens, who have\nencountered the dangers and privations of a long and toilsome journey, and\nhave at length found an abiding place for themselves and their families\nupon the utmost verge of our western limits, should be secured in the homes\nwhich they have improved by their labor. I refer you to the accompanying\nreport of the Secretary of War for a detailed account of the operations of\nthe various branches of the public service connected with the Department\nunder his charge. The duties devolving on this Department have been\nunusually onerous and responsible during the past year, and have been\ndischarged with ability and success.</p>\n\n<p>Pacific relations continue to exist with the various Indian tribes, and\nmost of them manifest a strong friendship for the United States. Some\ndepredations were committed during the past year upon our trains\ntransporting supplies for the Army, on the road between the western border\nof Missouri and Santa Fe. These depredations, which are supposed to have\nbeen committed by bands from the region of New Mexico, have been arrested\nby the presence of a military force ordered out for that purpose. Some\noutrages have been perpetrated by a portion of the northwestern bands upon\nthe weaker and comparatively defenseless neighboring tribes. Prompt\nmeasures were taken to prevent such occurrences in future.</p>\n\n<p>Between 1,000 and 2,000 Indians, belonging to several tribes, have been\nremoved during the year from the east of the Mississippi to the country\nallotted to them west of that river as their permanent home, and\narrangements have been made for others to follow.</p>\n\n<p>Since the treaty of 1846 with the Cherokees the feuds among them appear to\nhave subsided, and they have become more united and contented than they\nhave been for many years past. The commissioners appointed in pursuance of\nthe act of June 27, 1846, to settle claims arising under the treaty of\n1835-36 with that tribe have executed their duties, and after a patient\ninvestigation and a full and fair examination of all the cases brought\nbefore them closed their labors in the month of July last. This is the\nfourth board of commissioners which has been organized under this treaty.\nAmple opportunity has been afforded to all those interested to bring\nforward their claims. No doubt is entertained that impartial justice has\nbeen done by the late board, and that all valid claims embraced by the\ntreaty have been considered and allowed. This result and the final\nsettlement to be made with this tribe under the treaty of 1846, which will\nbe completed and laid before you during your session, will adjust all\nquestions of controversy between them and the United States and produce a\nstate of relations with them simple, well defined, and satisfactory. Under\nthe discretionary authority conferred by the act of the 3d of March last\nthe annuities due to the various tribes have been paid during the present\nyear to the heads of families instead of to their chiefs or such persons as\nthey might designate, as required by the law previously existing. This mode\nof payment has given general satisfaction to the great body of the Indians.\nJustice has been done to them, and they are grateful to the Government for\nit. A few chiefs and interested persons may object to this mode of payment,\nbut it is believed to be the only mode of preventing fraud and imposition\nfrom being practiced upon the great body of common Indians, constituting a\nmajority of all the tribes. It is gratifying to perceive that a number of\nthe tribes have recently manifested an increased interest in the\nestablishment of schools among them, and are making rapid advances in\nagriculture, some of them producing a sufficient quantity of food for their\nsupport and in some cases a surplus to dispose of to their neighbors. The\ncomforts by which those who have received even a very limited education and\nhave engaged in agriculture are surrounded tend gradually to draw off their\nless civilized brethren from the precarious means of subsistence by the\nchase to habits of labor and civilization.</p>\n\n<p>The accompanying report of the Secretary of the Navy presents a\nsatisfactory and gratifying account of the condition and operations of the\nnaval service during the past year. Our commerce has been pursued with\nincreased activity and with safety and success in every quarter of the\nglobe under the protection of our flag, which the Navy has caused to be\nrespected in the most distant seas.</p>\n\n<p>In the Gulf of Mexico and in the Pacific the officers and men of our\nsquadrons have displayed distinguished gallantry and performed valuable\nservices. In the early stages of the war with Mexico her ports on both\ncoasts were blockaded, and more recently many of them have been captured\nand held by the Navy. When acting in cooperation with the land forces, the\nnaval officers and men have performed gallant and distinguished services on\nland as well as on water, and deserve the high commendation of the\ncountry.</p>\n\n<p>While other maritime powers are adding to their navies large numbers of war\nsteamers, it was a wise policy on our part to make similar additions to our\nNavy. The four war steamers authorized by the act of the 3d of March, 1847,\nare in course of construction.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the four war steamers authorized by this act, the Secretary\nof the Navy has, in pursuance of its provisions, entered into contracts for\nthe construction of five steamers to be employed in the transportation of\nthe United States mail "from New York to New Orleans, touching at\nCharleston, Savannah, and Havana, and from Havana to Chagres;" for three\nsteamers to be employed in like manner from Panama to Oregon, "so as to\nconnect with the mail from Havana to Chagres across the Isthmus;" and for\nfive steamers to be employed in like manner from New York to Liverpool.\nThese steamers will be the property of the contractors, but are to be built\n"under the superintendence and direction of a naval constructor in the\nemploy of the Navy Department, and to be so constructed as to render them\nconvertible at the least possible expense into war steamers of the first\nclass." A prescribed number of naval officers, as well as a post-office\nagent, are to be on board of them, and authority is reserved to the Navy\nDepartment at all times to "exercise control over said steamships" and "to\nhave the right to take them for the exclusive use and service of the United\nStates upon making proper compensation to the contractors therefor."</p>\n\n<p>Whilst these steamships will be employed in transporting the mails of the\nUnited States coastwise and to foreign countries upon an annual\ncompensation to be paid to the owners, they will be always ready, upon an\nemergency requiring it, to be converted into war steamers; and the right\nreserved to take them for public use will add greatly to the efficiency and\nstrength of this description of our naval force. To the steamers thus\nauthorized under contracts made by the Secretary of the Navy should be\nadded five other steamers authorized under contracts made in pursuance of\nlaws by the Postmaster-General, making an addition, in the whole, of\neighteen war steamers subject to be taken for public use. As further\ncontracts for the transportation of the mail to foreign countries may be\nauthorized by Congress, this number may be enlarged indefinitely.</p>\n\n<p>The enlightened policy by which a rapid communication with the various\ndistant parts of the globe is established, by means of American built sea\nsteamers, would find an ample reward in the increase of our commerce and in\nmaking our country and its resources more favorably known abroad; but the\nnational advantage is still greater--of having our naval officers made\nfamiliar with steam navigation and of having the privilege of taking the\nships already equipped for immediate service at a moment\'s notice, and will\nbe cheaply purchased by the compensation to be paid for the transportation\nof the mail in them over and above the postages received.</p>\n\n<p>A just national pride, no less than our commercial interests, would Seem to\nfavor the policy of augmenting the number of this description of vessels.\nThey can be built in our country cheaper and in greater numbers than in any\nother in the world.</p>\n\n<p>I refer you to the accompanying report of the Postmaster-General for a\ndetailed and satisfactory account of the condition and operations of that\nDepartment during the past year. It is gratifying to find that within so\nshort a period after the reduction in the rates of postage, and\nnotwithstanding the great increase of mail service, the revenue received\nfor the year will be sufficient to defray all the expenses, and that no\nfurther aid will be required from the Treasury for that purpose.</p>\n\n<p>The first of the American mail steamers authorized by the act of the 3d of\nMarch, 1845, was completed and entered upon the service on the 1st of June\nlast, and is now on her third voyage to Bremen and other intermediate\nports. The other vessels authorized under the provisions of that act are in\ncourse of construction, and will be put upon the line as soon as completed.\nContracts have also been made for the transportation of the mail in a\nsteamer from Charleston to Havana.</p>\n\n<p>A reciprocal and satisfactory postal arrangement has been made by the\nPostmaster-General with the authorities of Bremen, and no difficulty is\napprehended in making similar arrangements with all other powers with which\nwe may have communications by mail steamers, except with Great Britain.</p>\n\n<p>On the arrival of the first of the American steamers bound to Bremen at\nSouthampton, in the month of June last, the British post-office directed\nthe collection of discriminating postages on all letters and other mailable\nmatter which she took out to Great Britain or which went into the British\npost-office on their way to France and other parts of Europe. The effect of\nthe order of the British, post-office is to subject all letters and other\nmatter transported by American steamers to double postage, one postage\nhaving been previously paid on them to the United States, while letters\ntransported in British steamers are subject to pay but a single postage.\nThis measure was adopted with the avowed object of protecting the British\nline of mail steamers now running between Boston and Liverpool, and if\npermitted to Continue must speedily put an end to the transportation of all\nletters and other matter by American steamers and give to British steamers\na monopoly of the business. A just and fair reciprocity is all that we\ndesire, and on this we must insist. By our laws no such discrimination is\nmade against British steamers bringing letters into our ports, but all\nletters arriving in the United States are subject to the same rate of\npostage, whether brought in British or American vessels. I refer you to the\nreport of the Postmaster-General for a full statement of the facts of the\ncase and of the steps taken by him to correct this inequality. He has\nexerted all the power conferred upon him by the existing laws.</p>\n\n<p>The minister of the United States at London has brought the subject to the\nattention of the British Government, and is now engaged in negotiations for\nthe purpose of adjusting reciprocal postal arrangements which shall be\nequally just to both countries. Should he fail in concluding such\narrangements, and should Great Britain insist on enforcing the unequal and\nunjust measure she has adopted, it will become necessary to confer\nadditional powers on the Postmaster-General in order to enable him to meet\nthe emergency and to put our own steamers on an equal footing with British\nsteamers engaged in transporting the mails between the two countries, and I\nrecommend that such powers be conferred. In view of the existing state of\nour country, I trust it may not be inappropriate, in closing this\ncommunication, to call to mind the words of wisdom and admonition of the\nfirst and most illustrious of my predecessors in his Farewell Address to\nhis countrymen.</p>\n\n<p>That greatest and best of men, who served his country so long and loved it\nso much, foresaw with "serious concern" the danger to our Union of\n"characterizing parties by geographical discriminations--Northern and\nSouthern, Atlantic and Western--whence designing men may endeavor to excite\na belief that there is a real difference of local interests and views," and\nwarned his countrymen against it.</p>\n\n<p>So deep and solemn was his conviction of the importance of the Union and of\npreserving harmony between its different parts, that he declared to his\ncountrymen in that address:</p>\n\n<p>It is of infinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense\nvalue of your national union to your collective and individual happiness;\nthat you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment to\nit; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the palladium of\nyour political safety and prosperity; watching for its preservation with\njealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may suggest even a suspicion\nthat it can in any event be abandoned, and indignantly frowning upon the\nfirst dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from\nthe rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various\nparts.</p>\n\n<p>After the lapse of half a century these admonitions of Washington fall upon\nus with all the force of truth. It is difficult to estimate the "immense\nvalue" of our glorious Union of confederated States, to which we are so\nmuch indebted for our growth in population and wealth and for all that\nconstitutes us a great and a happy nation. How unimportant are all our\ndifferences of opinion upon minor questions of public policy compared with\nits preservation, and how scrupulously should we avoid all agitating topics\nwhich may tend to distract and divide us into contending parties, separated\nby geographical lines, whereby it may be weakened or endangered.</p>\n\n<p>Invoking the blessing of the Almighty Ruler of the Universe upon your\ndeliberations, it will be my highest duty, no less than my sincere\npleasure, to cooperate with you in all measures which may tend to promote\nthe honor and enduring welfare of our common country.</p>\n\n<p>JAMES K.
