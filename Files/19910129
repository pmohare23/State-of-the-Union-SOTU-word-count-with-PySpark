Bush</h2>\n\t\t\t<h3>January 29, 1991</h3>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p>\nMr. President, Mr. Speaker, members of the United States Congress.</p>\n\n<p>I come to this house of the people to speak to you and all Americans,\ncertain we stand at a defining hour.</p>\n\n<p>Halfway around the world, we are engaged in a great struggle in the skies\nand on the seas and sands. We know why we\'re there. We are Americans--part\nof something larger than ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>For two centuries we\'ve done the hard work of freedom. And tonight we lead\nthe world in facing down a threat to decency and humanity.</p>\n\n<p>What is at stake is more than one small country, it is a big idea--a new\nworld order, where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause to\nachieve the universal aspirations of mankind: peace and security, freedom,\nand the rule of law. Such is a world worthy of our struggle, and worthy of\nour children\'s future.</p>\n\n<p>The community of nations has resolutely gathered to condemn and repel\nlawless aggression. Saddam Hussein\'s unprovoked invasion--his ruthless,\nsystematic rape of a peaceful neighbor--violated everything the community\nof nations holds dear. The world has said this aggression would not stand,\nand it will not stand.</p>\n\n<p>Together, we have resisted the trap of appeasement, cynicism and isolation\nthat gives temptation to tyrants. The world has answered Saddam\'s invasion\nwith 12 United Nations resolutions, starting with a demand for Iraq\'s\nimmediate and unconditional withdrawal, and backed up by forces from 28\ncountries of six continents. With few exceptions, the world now stands as\none.</p>\n\n<p>The end of the cold war has been a victory for all humanity. A year and a\nhalf ago, in Germany, I said our goal was a Europe whole and free. Tonight,\nGermany is united. Europe has become whole and free, and America\'s\nleadership was instrumental in making it possible.</p>\n\n<p>The principle that has guided us is simple: our objective is to help the\nBaltic peoples achieve their aspirations, not to punish the Soviet Union.\nIn our recent discussions with the Soviet leadership we have been given\nrepresentations, which, if fulfilled, would result in the withdrawal of\nsome Soviet forces, a re-opening of dialogue with the republics, and a move\naway from violence.</p>\n\n<p>We will watch carefully as the situation develops. And we will maintain our\ncontact with the Soviet leadership to encourage continued commitment to\ndemocratization and reform.</p>\n\n<p>If it is possible, I want to continue to build a lasting basis for\nU.S.-Soviet cooperation, for a more peaceful future for all mankind.</p>\n\n<p>The triumph of democratic ideas in Eastern Europe and Latin America, and\nthe continuing struggle for freedom elsewhere around the world all confirm\nthe wisdom of our nation\'s founders.</p>\n\n<p>Tonight, we work to achieve another victory, a victory over tyranny and\nsavage aggression.</p>\n\n<p>We in this Union enter the last decade of the 20th Century thankful for all\nour blessings, steadfast in our purpose, aware of our difficulties and\nresponsive to our duties at home and around the world.</p>\n\n<p>For two centuries, America has served the world as an inspiring example of\nfreedom and democracy. For generations, America has led the struggle to\npreserve and extend the blessings of liberty. And today, in a rapidly\nchanging world, American leadership is indispensable. Americans know that\nleadership brings burdens, and requires sacrifice.</p>\n\n<p>But we also know why the hopes of humanity turn to us. We are Americans; we\nhave a unique responsibility to do the hard work of freedom. And when we\ndo, freedom works.</p>\n\n<p>The conviction and courage we see in the Persian Gulf today is simply the\nAmerican character in action. The indomitable spirit that is contributing\nto this victory for world peace and justice is the same spirit that gives\nus the power and the potential to meet our challenges at home.</p>\n\n<p>We are resolute and resourceful. If we can selflessly confront evil for the\nsake of good in a land so far away, then surely we can make this land all\nit should be.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone tells you America\'s best days are behind her, they\'re looking the\nwrong way.</p>\n\n<p>Tonight, I come before this house, and the American people, with an appeal\nfor renewal. This is not merely a call for new government initiatives, it\nis a call for new initiative in government, in our communities, and from\nevery American--to prepare for the next American century.</p>\n\n<p>America has always led by example. So who among us will set this example?\nWhich of our citizens will lead us in this next American century? Everyone\nwho steps forward today, to get one addict off drugs; to convince one\ntroubled teen-ager not to give up on life; to comfort one AIDS patient; to\nhelp one hungry child.</p>\n\n<p>We have within our reach the promise of renewed America. We can find\nmeaning and reward by serving some purpose higher than ourselves--a\nshining purpose, the illumination of a thousand points of light. It is\nexpressed by all who know the irresistible force of a child\'s hand, of a\nfriend who stands by you and stays there--a volunteer\'s generous gesture,\nan idea that is simply right.</p>\n\n<p>The problems before us may be different, but the key to solving them\nremains the same: it is the individual--the individual who steps forward.\nAnd the state of our Union is the union of each of us, one to the other:\nthe sum of our friendships, marriages, families and communities.</p>\n\n<p>We all have something to give. So if you know how to read, find someone who\ncan\'t. If you\'ve got a hammer, find a nail. If you\'re not hungry, not\nlonely, not in trouble--seek out someone who is.</p>\n\n<p>Join the community of conscience. Do the hard work of freedom. That will\ndefine the state of our Union.</p>\n\n<p>Since the birth of our nation, "we the people" has been the source of our\nstrength. What government can do alone is limited, but the potential of the\nAmerican people knows no limits.</p>\n\n<p>We are a nation of rock-solid realism and clear-eyed idealism. We are\nAmericans. We are the nation that believes in the future. We are the nation\nthat can shape the future.</p>\n\n<p>And we\'ve begun to do just that, by strengthening the power and choice of\nindividuals and families.</p>\n\n<p>Together, these last two years, we\'ve put dollars for child care directly\nin the hands of patients instead of bureaucracies, unshackled the potential\nof Americans with disabilities, applied the creativity of the marketplace in\nthe service of the environment, for clean air, and made homeownership\npossible for more Americans.</p>\n\n<p>The strength of a democracy is not in bureaucracy, it is in the people and\ntheir communities. In everything we do, let us unleash the potential of our\nmost precious resource--our citizens. We must return to families,\ncommunities, counties, cities, states and institutions of every kind, the\npower to chart their own destiny, and the freedom and opportunity provided\nby strong economic growth. That\'s what America is all about.</p>\n\n<p>I know, tonight, in some regions of our country, people are in genuine\neconomic distress. I hear them.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier this month Kathy Blackwell of Massachusetts wrote me about what can\nhappen when the economy slows down, saying, "My heart is aching, and I\nthink that you should know--your people out here are hurting badly."</p>\n\n<p>I understand. And I\'m not unrealistic about the future. But there are\nreasons to be optimistic about our economy.</p>\n\n<p>First, we don\'t have to fight double-digit inflation. Second, most\nindustries won\'t have to make big cuts in production because they don\'t\nhave big inventories piled up. And third, our exports are running solid and\nstrong. In fact, American businesses are exporting at a record rate.</p>\n\n<p>So let\'s put these times in perspective. Together, since 1981, we\'ve\ncreated almost 20 million jobs, cut inflation in half and cut interest\nrates in half.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, the largest peacetime economic expansion in history has been\ntemporarily interrupted. But our economy is still over twice as large as\nour closest competitor.</p>\n\n<p>We will get this recession behind us and return to growth soon. We will get\non our way to a new record of expansion, and achieve the competitive\nstrength that will carry us into the next American century.</p>\n\n<p>We should focus our efforts today on encouraging economic growth, investing\nin the future and giving power and opportunity to the individual.</p>\n\n<p>We must begin with control of Federal spending. That\'s why I\'m submitting a\nbudget that holds the growth in spending to less than the rate of\ninflation. And that\'s why, amid all the sound and fury of last year\'s\nbudget debate, we put into law new, enforceable spending caps so that\nfuture spending debates will mean a battle of ideas, not a bidding war.</p>\n\n<p>Though controversial, the budget agreement finally put the Federal\nGovernment on a pay-as-you-go basis, and cut the growth of debt by nearly\n$500 billion. And that frees funds for saving and job-creating investment.</p>\n\n<p>Now, let\'s do more. My budget again includes tax-free family savings\naccounts; penalty-free withdrawals from I. R. A.\'s for first-time\nhomebuyers; and, to increase jobs and growth, a reduced tax for long-term\ncapital gains.</p>\n\n<p>I know their are differences among us about the impact and the effects of a\ncapital gains incentive. So tonight I am asking the Congressional leaders\nand the Federal Reserve to cooperate with us in a study, led by Chairman\nAlan Greenspan, to sort out our technical differences so that we can avoid\na return to unproductive partisan bickering.</p>\n\n<p>But just as our efforts will bring economic growth now and in the future,\nthey must also be matched by long-term investments for the next American\ncentury.</p>\n\n<p>That requires a forward-looking plan of action, and that\'s exactly what we\nwill be sending to the Congress. We have prepared a detailed series of\nproposals, that include: A budget that promotes investment in America\'s\nfuture--in children, education, infrastructure, space and high technology.\nLegislation to achieve excellence in education, building on the partnership\nforged with the 50 governors at the education summit, enabling parents to\nchoose their children\'s schools and helping to make America No. 1 in math\nand science. A blueprint for a new national highway system, a critical\ninvestment in our transportation infrastructure. A research and development\nagenda that includes record levels of Federal investment and a permanent\ntax credit to strengthen private R and D and create jobs. A comprehensive\nnational energy strategy that calls for energy conservation and efficiency,\nincreased development and greater use of alternative fuels. A banking\nreform plan to bring America\'s financial system into the 21st Century, so\nthat our banks remain safe and secure and can continue to make job-creating\nloans for our factories, businesses, and homebuyers. I do think there has\nbeen too much pessimism. Sound banks should be making more sound loans,\nnow. And interest rates should be lower, now. In addition to these\nproposals, we must recognize that our economic strength depends upon being\ncompetitive in world markets. We must continue to expand America\'s exports.\nA successful Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations will create more\nreal jobs, and more real growth, for all nations. You and I know that if\nthe playing field is level, America\'s workers and farmers can outwork and\noutproduce anyone, anytime, anywhere.</p>\n\n<p>And with the Mexican free trade agreement and our Enterprise for the\nAmericas Initiative we can help our partners strengthen their economies and\nmove toward a free trade zone throughout this entire hemisphere.</p>\n\n<p>The budget also includes a plan of action right here at home to put more\npower and opportunity in the hands of the individual. That means new\nincentives to create jobs in our inner cities by encouraging investment\nthrough enterprise zones. It also means tenant control and ownership of\npublic housing. Freedom and the power to choose should not be the privilege\nof wealth. They are the birthright of every American.</p>\n\n<p>Civil rights are also crucial to protecting equal opportunity. Every one of\nus has a responsibility to speak out against racism, bigotry, and hate. We\nwill continue our vigorous enforcement of existing statutes, and I will once\nagain press the Congress to strengthen the laws against employment\ndiscrimination without resorting to the use of unfair preferences.</p>\n\n<p>We\'re determined to protect another fundamental civil right: freedom from\ncrime and the fear that stalks our cities. The Attorney General will soon\nconvene a crime summit of the nation\'s law-enforcement officials. And to\nhelp us support them we need a tough crime control legislation, and we need\nit now.</p>\n\n<p>As we fight crime, we will fully implement our nation strategy for\ncombatting drug abuse. Recent data show we are making progress, but much\nremains to be done. We will not rest until the day of the dealer is over,\nforever.</p>\n\n<p>Good health care is every American\'s right and every American\'s\nresponsibility. So we are proposing an aggression program of new prevention\ninitiatives--for infants, for children, for adults, and for the elderly--\nto promote a healthier America and to help keep costs from spiraling.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s time to give people more choice in government by reviving the ideal of\nthe citizen politician who comes not to stay, but to serve. One of the\nreasons there is so much support for term limitations is that the American\npeople are increasingly concerned about big-money influence in politics.\nWe must look beyond the next election, to the next generation. The time has\ncome to put the national interest ahead of the special interest--and\ntotally eliminate political action committees.</p>\n\n<p>That would truly put more competition in elections and more power in the\nhands of individuals. And where power cannot be put directly into the hands\nof the individual, it should be moved closer to the people--away from\nWashington.</p>\n\n<p>The federal government too often treats government programs as if they are\nof Washington, by Washington, and for Washington. Once established, federal\nprograms seem to become immortal.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s time for a more dynamic program life cycle. Some programs should\nincrease. Some should decrease. Some should be terminated. And some should\nbe consolidated and turned over to the states.</p>\n\n<p>My budget includes a list of programs for potential turnover totaling more\nthan $20 billion. Working with Congress and the governors, I propose we\nselect at least $15 billion in such programs and turn them over to the\nstates in a single consolidated grant, fully funded, for flexible\nmanagement by the states.</p>\n\n<p>The value of this turnover approach is straightforward. It allows the\nFederal Government to reduce overhead. It allows states to manage more\nflexibly and more efficiently. It moves power and decision-making closer to\nthe people. And it re-enforces a theme of this Administration: appreciation\nand encouragement of the innovative power of "states as laboratories."</p>\n\n<p>This nation was founded by leaders who understood that power belongs in the\nhands of the people. They planned for the future. And so must we--here and\naround the world.</p>\n\n<p>As Americans, we know there are times when we must step forward and accept\nour responsibility to lead the world away from the dark chaos of dictators,\ntoward the bright promise of a better day.</p>\n\n<p>Almost 50 years ago, we began a long struggle against aggressive\ntotalitarianism. Now we face another defining hour for America and the\nworld.</p>\n\n<p>There is no one more devoted, more committed to the hard work of freedom,\nthan every soldier and sailor, every marine, airman and coastguardsman--\nevery man and every woman now serving in the Persian Gulf.</p>\n\n<p>Each of them has volunteered to provide for this nation\'s defense. And now\nthey bravely struggle to earn for America and for the world and for future\ngenerations, a just and lasting peace.</p>\n\n<p>Our commitment to them must be equal of their commitment to our country.\nThey are truly America\'s finest.</p>\n\n<p>The war in the gulf is not a war we wanted. We worked hard to avoid war.\nFor more than five months we, along with the Arab League, the European\nCommunity and the United Nations, tried every diplomatic avenue. U.N.\nSecretary General Perez de Cuellar; Presidents Gorbachev, Mitterand, Ozal,\nMubarak, and Bendjedid; Kings Fahd and Hassan; Prime Ministers Major and\nAndreotti--just to name a few--all worked for a solution. But time and\nagain Saddam Hussein flatly rejected the path of diplomacy and peace.</p>\n\n<p>The world well knows how this conflict began, and when: it began on August\n2nd, when Saddam invaded and sacked a small, defenseless neighbor. And I am\ncertain of how it will end. So that peace can prevail, we will prevail.</p>\n\n<p>Tonight I\'m pleased to report that we are on course. Iraq\'s capacity to\nsustain war is being destroyed. Our investment, our training, our planning\n--all are paying off. Time will not be Saddam\'s salvation.</p>\n\n<p>Our purpose in the Persian Gulf remains constant: to drive Iraq out from\nKuwait, to restore Kuwait\'s legitimate government, and to insure the\nstability and security of this critical region.</p>\n\n<p>Let me make clear what I mean by the region\'s stability and security. We do\nnot seek the destruction of Iraq, its culture or its people. Rather, we\nseek an Iraq that uses its great resources not to destroy, not to serve the\nambitions of a tyrant, but to build a better life for itself and its\nneighbors. We seek a Persian Gulf where conflict is no longer the rule,\nwhere the strong are neither tempted nor able to intimidate the weak.</p>\n\n<p>Most Americans know instinctively why we are in the Gulf. They know we had\nto stop Saddam now, not later. They know this brutal dictator will do\nanything, will use any weapon, will commit any outrage, no matter how many\ninnocents must suffer.</p>\n\n<p>They know we must make sure that control of the world\'s oil resources does\nnot fall into his hands only to finance further aggression. They know that\nwe need to build a new, enduring peace--based not on arms races and\nconfrontation, but on shared principles and the rule of law.</p>\n\n<p>And we all realize that our responsibility to be the catalyst for peace in\nthe region does not end with the successful conclusion of this war.</p>\n\n<p>Democracy brings the undeniable value of thoughtful dissent, and we have\nheard some dissenting voices here at home, some reckless, most responsible.\nBut the fact the all the voices have the right to speak out is one of the\nreasons we\'ve been united in principle and purpose for 200 years.</p>\n\n<p>Our progress in this great struggle is the result of years of vigilance and\na steadfast commitment to a strong defense. Now, with remarkable\ntechnological advances like the Patriot missile, we can defend the\nballistic missile attacks aimed at innocent civilians.</p>\n\n<p>Looking forward, I have directed that the S.D.I. program be refocused on\nproviding protection from limited ballistic missile strikes, whatever their\nsource. Let us pursue an S.D.I. program that can deal with any future\nthreat to the United States, to our forces overseas and to our friends and\nallies.</p>\n\n<p>The quality of American technology, thanks to the American worker, has\nenabled us to successfully deal with difficult military conditions, and\nhelp minimize the loss of life. We have given our men and women the very\nbest. And they deserve it.</p>\n\n<p>We all have a special place in our hearts for the families of men and women\nserving in the Gulf. They are represented here tonight, by Mrs. Norman\nSchwarzkopf, and to all those serving with him. And to the families, let me\nsay, our forces in the gulf will not stay there one day longer than is\nnecessary to complete their mission.</p>\n\n<p>The courage and success of the R.A.F. pilots--of the Kuwaiti, Saudi,\nFrench, Canadians, Italians, the pilots of Qatar and Bahrain--all are\nproof that for the first time since World War II, the international\ncommunity is united. The leadership of the United Nations, once only a\nhoped-for ideal, is now confirming its founders\' vision.</p>\n\n<p>I am heartened that we are not being asked to bear alone the financial\nburden of this struggle. Last year, our friends and allies provided the\nbulk of the economic costs of Desert Shield, and having now received\ncommitments of over $40 billion for the first three months of 1991, I am\nconfident they will do no less as we move through Desert Storm.</p>\n\n<p>But the world has to wonder what the dictator of Iraq is thinking. If he\nthinks that by targeting innocent civilians in Israel and Saudi Arabia,\nthat he will gain an advantage--he is dead wrong. If he thinks that he\nwill advance his cause through tragic and despicable environmental\nterrorism--he is dead wrong. And if he thinks that by abusing coalition\nP.O.W.s, he will benefit--he is dead wrong.</p>\n\n<p>We will succeed in the Gulf. And when we do, the world community will have\nsent an enduring warning to any dictator or despot, present or future, who\ncontemplates outlaw aggression.</p>\n\n<p>The world can therefore seize this opportunity to fulfill the long-held\npromise of a new world order--where brutality will go unrewarded, and\naggression will meet collective resistance.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, the United States bears a major share of leadership in this effort.\nAmong the nations of the world, only the United States of America has had\nboth the moral standing, and the means to back it up. We are the only\nnation on this earth that could assemble the forces of peace.</p>\n\n<p>This is the burden of leadership--and the strength that has made America\nthe beacon of freedom in a searching world.</p>\n\n<p>This nation has never found glory in war. Our people have never wanted to\nabandon the blessings of home and work, for distant lands and deadly\nconflict. If we fight in anger, it is only because we have to fight at all.\nAnd all of us yearn for a world where we will never have to fight again.</p>\n\n<p>Each of us will measure, within ourselves, the value of this great\nstruggle. Any cost in lives is beyond our power to measure. But the cost of\nclosing our eyes to aggression is beyond mankind\'s power to imagine.</p>\n\n<p>This we do know: Our cause is just. Our cause is moral. Our cause is\nright.</p>\n\n<p>Let future generations understand the burden and the blessings of freedom.\nLet them say, we stood where duty required us to stand.</p>\n\n<p>Let them know that together, we affirmed America, and the world, as a\ncommunity of conscience.</p>\n\n<p>The winds of change are with us now. The forces of freedom are united. We\nmove toward the next century, more confident than ever, that we have the\nwill at home and abroad, to do what must be done--the hard work of\nfreedom.</p>\n\n<p>May God bless the United States of America.\n</p>\n\t\t\t<div class="textNav"><a href="#top">^ Return to top</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>\n\t<div id="footer"><strong><em>State of the Union</em></strong> is a project\n\t\tby Brad Borevitz at <a href="http://www.onetwothree.net">onetwothree.net</a></div>\n</div>\n<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">\n</script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n_uacct = "UA-410742-1";\nurchinTracker();\n</script>\n</body>\n<!-- InstanceEnd -->\n</html>\n'
