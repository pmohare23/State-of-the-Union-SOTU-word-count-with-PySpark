Johnson</h2>\n\t\t\t<h3>January 8, 1964</h3>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p>\nMr. Speaker, Mr. President, Members of the House and Senate, my fellow\nAmericans:</p>\n\n<p>I will be brief, for our time is necessarily short and our agenda is\nalready long.</p>\n\n<p>Last year\'s congressional session was the longest in peacetime history.\nWith that foundation, let us work together to make this year\'s session the\nbest in the Nation\'s history.</p>\n\n<p>Let this session of Congress be known as the session which did more for\ncivil rights than the last hundred sessions combined; as the session which\nenacted the most far-reaching tax cut of our time; as the session which\ndeclared all-out war on human poverty and unemployment in these United\nStates; as the session which finally recognized the health needs of all our\nolder citizens; as the session which reformed our tangled transportation\nand transit policies; as the session which achieved the most effective,\nefficient foreign aid program ever; and as the session which helped to\nbuild more homes, more schools, more libraries, and more hospitals than any\nsingle session of Congress in the history of our Republic.</p>\n\n<p>All this and more can and must be done. It can be done by this summer, and\nit can be done without any increase in spending. In fact, under the budget\nthat I shall shortly submit, it can be done with an actual reduction in\nFederal expenditures and Federal employment.</p>\n\n<p>We have in 1964 a unique opportunity and obligation--to prove the success\nof our system; to disprove those cynics and critics at home and abroad who\nquestion our purpose and our competence.</p>\n\n<p>If we fail, if we fritter and fumble away our opportunity in needless,\nsenseless quarrels between Democrats and Republicans, or between the House\nand the Senate, or between the South and North, or between the Congress and\nthe administration, then history will rightfully judge us harshly. But if\nwe succeed, if we can achieve these goals by forging in this country a\ngreater sense of union, then, and only then, can we take full satisfaction\nin the State of the Union. II.</p>\n\n<p>Here in the Congress you can demonstrate effective legislative leadership\nby discharging the public business with clarity and dispatch, voting each\nimportant proposal up, or voting it down, but at least bringing it to a\nfair and a final vote.</p>\n\n<p>Let us carry forward the plans and programs of John Fitzgerald Kennedy--not\nbecause of our sorrow or sympathy, but because they are right.</p>\n\n<p>In his memory today, I especially ask all members of my own political\nfaith, in this election year, to put your country ahead of your party, and\nto always debate principles; never debate personalities.</p>\n\n<p>For my part, I pledge a progressive administration which is efficient, and\nhonest and frugal. The budget to be submitted to the Congress shortly is in\nfull accord with this pledge.</p>\n\n<p>It will cut our deficit in half--from $10 billion to $4,900 million. It\nwill be, in proportion to our national output, the smallest budget since\n1951.</p>\n\n<p>It will call for a substantial reduction in Federal employment, a feat\naccomplished only once before in the last 10 years. While maintaining the\nfull strength of our combat defenses, it will call for the lowest number of\ncivilian personnel in the Department of Defense since 1950.</p>\n\n<p>It will call for total expenditures of $97,900 million--compared to $98,400\nmillion for the current year, a reduction of more than $500 million. It\nwill call for new obligational authority of $103,800 million--a reduction\nof more than $4 billion below last year\'s request of $107,900 million.</p>\n\n<p>But it is not a standstill budget, for America cannot afford to stand\nstill. Our population is growing. Our economy is more complex. Our people\'s\nneeds are expanding.</p>\n\n<p>But by closing down obsolete installations, by curtailing less urgent\nprograms, by cutting back where cutting back seems to be wise, by insisting\non a dollar\'s worth for a dollar spent, I am able to recommend in this\nreduced budget the most Federal support in history for education, for\nhealth, for retraining the unemployed, and for helping the economically and\nthe physically handicapped.</p>\n\n<p>This budget, and this year\'s legislative program, are designed to help each\nand every American citizen fulfill his basic hopes--his hopes for a fair\nchance to make good; his hopes for fair play from the law; his hopes for a\nfull-time job on full-time pay; his hopes for a decent home for his family\nin a decent community; his hopes for a good school for his children with\ngood teachers; and his hopes for security when faced with sickness or\nunemployment or old age. III.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, many Americans live on the outskirts of hope--some because\nof their poverty, and some because of theft color, and all too many because\nof both. Our task is to help replace their despair with opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>This administration today, here and now, declares unconditional war on\npoverty in America. I urge this Congress and all Americans to join with me\nin that effort.</p>\n\n<p>It will not be a short or easy struggle, no single weapon or strategy will\nsuffice, but we shall not rest until that war is won. The richest Nation on\nearth can afford to win it. We cannot afford to lose it. One thousand\ndollars invested in salvaging an unemployable youth today can return\n$40,000 or more in his lifetime.</p>\n\n<p>Poverty is a national problem, requiring improved national organization and\nsupport. But this attack, to be effective, must also be organized at the\nState and the local level and must be supported and directed by State and\nlocal efforts.</p>\n\n<p>For the war against poverty will not be won here in Washington. It must be\nwon in the field, in every private home, in every public office, from the\ncourthouse to the White House.</p>\n\n<p>The program I shall propose will emphasize this cooperative approach to\nhelp that one-fifth of all American families with incomes too small to even\nmeet their basic needs.</p>\n\n<p>Our chief weapons in a more pinpointed attack will be better schools, and\nbetter health, and better homes, and better training, and better job\nopportunities to help more Americans, especially young Americans, escape\nfrom squalor and misery and unemployment rolls where other citizens help to\ncarry them.</p>\n\n<p>Very often a lack of jobs and money is not the cause of poverty, but the\nsymptom. The cause may lie deeper in our failure to give our fellow\ncitizens a fair chance to develop their own capacities, in a lack of\neducation and training, in a lack of medical care and housing, in a lack of\ndecent communities in which to live and bring up their children.</p>\n\n<p>But whatever the cause, our joint Federal-local effort must pursue poverty,\npursue it wherever it exists--in city slums and small towns, in\nsharecropper shacks or in migrant worker camps, on Indian Reservations,\namong whites as well as Negroes, among the young as well as the aged, in\nthe boom towns and in the depressed areas.</p>\n\n<p>Our aim is not only to relieve the symptom of poverty, but to cure it and,\nabove all, to prevent it. No single piece of legislation, however, is going\nto suffice.</p>\n\n<p>We will launch a special effort in the chronically distressed areas of\nAppalachia.</p>\n\n<p>We must expand our small but our successful area redevelopment program.</p>\n\n<p>We must enact youth employment legislation to put jobless, aimless,\nhopeless youngsters to work on useful projects.</p>\n\n<p>We must distribute more food to the needy through a broader food stamp\nprogram.</p>\n\n<p>We must create a National Service Corps to help the economically\nhandicapped of our own country as the Peace Corps now helps those abroad.</p>\n\n<p>We must modernize our unemployment insurance and establish a high-level\ncommission on automation. If we have the brain power to invent these\nmachines, we have the brain power to make certain that they are a boon and\nnot a bane to humanity.</p>\n\n<p>We must extend the coverage of our minimum wage laws to more than 2 million\nworkers now lacking this basic protection of purchasing power.</p>\n\n<p>We must, by including special school aid funds as part of our education\nprogram, improve the quality of teaching, training, and counseling in our\nhardest hit areas.</p>\n\n<p>We must build more libraries in every area and more hospitals and nursing\nhomes under the Hill-Burton Act, and train more nurses to staff them.</p>\n\n<p>We must provide hospital insurance for our older citizens financed by every\nworker and his employer under Social Security, contributing no more than $1\na month during the employee\'s working career to protect him in his old age\nin a dignified manner without cost to the Treasury, against the devastating\nhardship of prolonged or repeated illness.</p>\n\n<p>We must, as a part of a revised housing and urban renewal program, give\nmore help to those displaced by slum clearance, provide more housing for\nour poor and our elderly, and seek as our ultimate goal in our free\nenterprise system a decent home for every American family.</p>\n\n<p>We must help obtain more modern mass transit within our communities as well\nas low-cost transportation between them.</p>\n\n<p>Above all, we must release $11 billion of tax reduction into the private\nspending stream to create new jobs and new markets in every area of this\nland. IV.</p>\n\n<p>These programs are obviously not for the poor or the underprivileged alone.\nEvery American will benefit by the extension of social security to cover\nthe hospital costs of their aged parents. Every American community will\nbenefit from the construction or modernization of schools, libraries,\nhospitals, and nursing homes, from the training of more nurses and from the\nimprovement of urban renewal in public transit. And every individual\nAmerican taxpayer and every corporate taxpayer will benefit from the\nearliest possible passage of the pending tax bill from both the new\ninvestment it will bring and the new jobs that it will create.</p>\n\n<p>That tax bill has been thoroughly discussed for a year. Now we need action.\nThe new budget clearly allows it. Our taxpayers surely deserve it. Our\neconomy strongly demands it. And every month of delay dilutes its benefits\nin 1964 for consumption, for investment, and for employment.</p>\n\n<p>For until the bill is signed, its investment incentives cannot be deemed\ncertain, and the withholding rate cannot be reduced--and the most damaging\nand devastating thing you can do to any businessman in America is to keep\nhim in doubt and to keep him guessing on what our tax policy is. And I say\nthat we should now reduce to 14 percent instead of 15 percent our\nwithholding rate.</p>\n\n<p>I therefore urge the Congress to take final action on this bill by the\nfirst of February, if at all possible. For however proud we may be of the\nunprecedented progress of our free enterprise economy over the last 3\nyears, we should not and we cannot permit it to pause.</p>\n\n<p>In 1963, for the first time in history, we crossed the 70 million job mark,\nbut we will soon need more than 75 million jobs. In 1963 our gross national\nproduct reached the $600 billion level--$100 billion higher than when we\ntook office. But it easily could and it should be still $30 billion higher\ntoday than it is.</p>\n\n<p>Wages and profits and family income are also at their highest levels in\nhistory--but I would remind you that 4 million workers and 13 percent of\nour industrial capacity are still idle today.</p>\n\n<p>We need a tax cut now to keep this country moving. V.</p>\n\n<p>For our goal is not merely to spread the work. Our goal is to create more\njobs. I believe the enactment of a 35-hour week would sharply increase\ncosts, would invite inflation, would impair our ability to compete, and\nmerely share instead of creating employment. But I am equally opposed to\nthe 45- or 50-hour week in those industries where consistently excessive\nuse of overtime causes increased unemployment.</p>\n\n<p>So, therefore, I recommend legislation authorizing the creation of a\ntripartite industry committee to determine on an industry-by-industry basis\nas to where a higher penalty rate for overtime would increase job openings\nwithout unduly increasing costs, and authorizing the establishment of such\nhigher rates. VI.</p>\n\n<p>Let me make one principle of this administration abundantly clear: All of\nthese increased opportunities--in employment, in education, in housing, and\nin every field--must be open to Americans of every color. As far as the writ\nof Federal law will run, we must abolish not some, but all racial\ndiscrimination. For this is not merely an economic issue, or a social,\npolitical, or international issue. It is a moral issue, and it must be met\nby the passage this session of the bill now pending in the House.</p>\n\n<p>All members of the public should have equal access to facilities open to\nthe public. All members of the public should be equally eligible for\nFederal benefits that are financed by the public. All members of the public\nshould have an equal chance to vote for public officials and to send their\nchildren to good public schools and to contribute their talents to the\npublic good.</p>\n\n<p>Today, Americans of all races stand side by side in Berlin and in Viet Nam.\nThey died side by side in Korea. Surely they can work and eat and travel\nside by side in their own country. VII.</p>\n\n<p>We must also lift by legislation the bars of discrimination against those\nwho seek entry into our country, particularly those who have much needed\nskills and those joining their families.</p>\n\n<p>In establishing preferences, a nation that was built by the immigrants of\nall lands can ask those who now seek admission: "What can you do for our\ncountry?" But we should not be asking: "In what country were you born?"\nVIII.</p>\n\n<p>For our ultimate goal is a world without war, a world made safe for\ndiversity, in which all men, goods, and ideas can freely move across every\nborder and every boundary.</p>\n\n<p>We must advance toward this goal in 1964 in at least 10 different ways, not\nas partisans, but as patriots.</p>\n\n<p>First, we must maintain--and our reduced defense budget will maintain--that\nmargin of military safety and superiority obtained through 3 years of\nsteadily increasing both the quality and the quantity of our strategic, our\nconventional, and our antiguerilla forces. In 1964 we will be better\nprepared than ever before to defend the cause of freedom, whether it is\nthreatened by outright aggression or by the infiltration practiced by those\nin Hanoi and Havana, who ship arms and men across international borders to\nfoment insurrection. And we must continue to use that strength as John\nKennedy used it in the Cuban crisis and for the test ban treaty--to\ndemonstrate both the futility of nuclear war and the possibilities of\nlasting peace.</p>\n\n<p>Second, we must take new steps--and we shall make new proposals at\nGeneva--toward the control and the eventual abolition of arms. Even in the\nabsence of agreement, we must not stockpile arms beyond our needs or seek\nan excess of military power that could be provocative as well as wasteful.</p>\n\n<p>It is in this spirit that in this fiscal year we are cutting back our\nproduction of enriched uranium by 25 percent. We are shutting down four\nplutonium piles. We are closing many nonessential military installations.\nAnd it is in this spirit that we today call on our adversaries to do the\nsame.</p>\n\n<p>Third, we must make increased use of our food as an instrument of\npeace--making it available by sale or trade or loan or donation--to hungry\npeople in all nations which tell us of their needs and accept proper\nconditions of distribution.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth, we must assure our pre-eminence in the peaceful exploration of\nouter space, focusing on an expedition to the moon in this decade--in\ncooperation with other powers if possible, alone if necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Fifth, we must expand world trade. Having recognized in the Act of 1962\nthat we must buy as well as sell, we now expect our trading partners to\nrecognize that we must sell as well as buy. We are willing to give them\ncompetitive access to our market, asking only that they do the same for\nus.</p>\n\n<p>Sixth, we must continue, through such measures as the interest equalization\ntax, as well as the cooperation of other nations, our recent progress\ntoward balancing our international accounts.</p>\n\n<p>This administration must and will preserve the present gold value of the\ndollar.</p>\n\n<p>Seventh, we must become better neighbors with the free states of the\nAmericas, working with the councils of the OAS, with a stronger Alliance\nfor Progress, and with all the men and women of this hemisphere who really\nbelieve in liberty and justice for all.</p>\n\n<p>Eighth, we must strengthen the ability of free nations everywhere to\ndevelop their independence and raise their standard of living, and thereby\nfrustrate those who prey on poverty and chaos. To do this, the rich must\nhelp the poor--and we must do our part. We must achieve a more rigorous\nadministration of our development assistance, with larger roles for private\ninvestors, for other industrialized nations, and for international agencies\nand for the recipient nations themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Ninth, we must strengthen our Atlantic and Pacific partnerships, maintain\nour alliances and make the United Nations a more effective instrument for\nnational independence and international order.</p>\n\n<p>Tenth, and finally, we must develop with our allies new means of bridging\nthe gap between the East and the West, facing danger boldly wherever danger\nexists, but being equally bold in our search for new agreements which can\nenlarge the hopes of all, while violating the interests of none.</p>\n\n<p>In short, I would say to the Congress that we must be constantly prepared\nfor the worst, and constantly acting for the best. We must be strong enough\nto win any war, and we must be wise enough to prevent one.</p>\n\n<p>We shall neither act as aggressors nor tolerate acts of aggression. We\nintend to bury no one, and we do not intend to be buried.</p>\n\n<p>We can fight, if we must, as we have fought before, but we pray that we\nwill never have to fight again. IX.</p>\n\n<p>My good friends and my fellow Americans: In these last 7 sorrowful weeks,\nwe have learned anew that nothing is so enduring as faith, and nothing is\nso degrading as hate.</p>\n\n<p>John Kennedy was a victim of hate, but he was also a great builder of\nfaith--faith in our fellow Americans, whatever their creed or their color\nor their station in life; faith in the future of man, whatever his\ndivisions and differences.</p>\n\n<p>This faith was echoed in all parts of the world. On every continent and in\nevery land to which Mrs. Johnson and I traveled, we found faith and hope\nand love toward this land of America and toward our people.</p>\n\n<p>So I ask you now in the Congress and in the country to join with me in\nexpressing and fulfilling that faith in working for a nation, a nation that\nis free from want and a world that is free from hate--a world of peace and\njustice, and freedom and abundance, for our time and for all time to come.\n</p>\n\t\t\t<div class="textNav"><a href="#top">^ Return to top</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>\n\t<div id="footer"><strong><em>State of the Union</em></strong> is a project\n\t\tby Brad Borevitz at <a href="http://www.onetwothree.net">onetwothree.net</a></div>\n</div>\n<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">\n</script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n_uacct = "UA-410742-1";\nurchinTracker();\n</script>\n</body>\n<!-- InstanceEnd -->\n</html>\n'
