I undertake this duty with diffidence,\nfrom the vast extent of the interests on which I have to treat and of their\ngreat importance to every portion of our Union. I enter on it with zeal\nfrom a thorough conviction that there never was a period since the\nestablishment of our Revolution when, regarding the condition of the\ncivilized world and its bearing on us, there was greater necessity for\ndevotion in the public servants to their respective duties, or for virtue,\npatriotism, and union in our constituents.</p>\n\n<p>Meeting in you a new Congress, I deem it proper to present this view of\npublic affairs in greater detail than might otherwise be necessary. I do\nit, however, with peculiar satisfaction, from a knowledge that in this\nrespect I shall comply more fully with the sound principles of our\nGovernment.</p>\n\n<p>The people being with us exclusively the sovereign, it is indispensable\nthat full information be laid before them on all important subjects, to\nenable them to exercise that high power with complete effect. If kept in\nthe dark, they must be incompetent to it. We are all liable to error, and\nthose who are engaged in the management of public affairs are more subject\nto excitement and to be led astray by their particular interests and\npassions than the great body of our constituents, who, living at home in\nthe pursuit of their ordinary avocations, are calm but deeply interested\nspectators of events and of the conduct of those who are parties to them.</p>\n\n<p>To the people every department of the Government and every individual in\neach are responsible, and the more full their information the better they\ncan judge of the wisdom of the policy pursued and of the conduct of each in\nregard to it. From their dispassionate judgment much aid may always be\nobtained, while their approbation will form the greatest incentive and most\ngratifying reward for virtuous actions, and the dread of their censure the\nbest security against the abuse of their confidence. Their interests in all\nvital questions are the same, and the bond, by sentiment as well as by\ninterest, will be proportionably strengthened as they are better informed\nof the real state of public affairs, especially in difficult conjunctures.\nIt is by such knowledge that local prejudices and jealousies are\nsurmounted, and that a national policy extending its fostering care and\nprotection to all the great interests of our Union, is formed and steadily\nadhered to.</p>\n\n<p>A precise knowledge of our relations with foreign powers as respects our\nnegotiations and transactions with each is thought to be particularly\nnecessary. Equally necessary is it that we should form a just estimate of\nour resources, revenue, and progress in every kind of improvement connected\nwith the national prosperity and public defense. It is by rendering justice\nto other nations that we may expect it from them. It is by our ability to\nresent injuries and redress wrongs that we may avoid them.</p>\n\n<p>The commissioners under the 5th article of the treaty of Ghent, having\ndisagreed in their opinions respecting that portion of the boundary between\nthe Territories of the United States and of Great Britain the establishment\nof which had been submitted to them, have made their respective reports in\ncompliance with that article, that the same might be referred to the\ndecision of a friendly power. It being manifest, however, that it would be\ndifficult, if not impossible, for any power to perform that office without\ngreat delay and much inconvenience to itself, a proposal has been made by\nthis Government, and acceded to by that of Great Britain, to endeavor to\nestablish that boundary by amicable negotiation.</p>\n\n<p>It appearing from long experience that no satisfactory arrangement could be\nformed of the commercial intercourse between the United States and the\nBritish colonies in this hemisphere by legislative acts while each party\npursued its own course without agreement or concert with the other, a\nproposal has been made to the British Government to regulate this commerce\nby treaty, as it has been to arrange in like manner the just claim of the\ncitizens of the United States inhabiting the States and Territories\nbordering on the lakes and rivers which empty into the St. Lawrence to the\nnavigation of that river to the ocean. For these and other objects of high\nimportance to the interests of both parties a negotiation has been opened\nwith the British Government which it is hoped will have a satisfactory\nresult.</p>\n\n<p>The commissioners under the 6th and 7th articles of the treaty of Ghent\nhaving successfully closed their labors in relation to the 6th, have\nproceeded to the discharge of those relating to the 7th. Their progress in\nthe extensive survey required for the performance of their duties justifies\nthe presumption that it will be completed in the ensuing year.</p>\n\n<p>The negotiation which had been long depending with the French Government on\nseveral important subjects, and particularly for a just indemnity for\nlosses sustained in the late wars by the citizens of the United States\nunder unjustifiable seizures and confiscations of their property, has not\nas yet had the desired effect. As this claim rests on the same principle\nwith others which have been admitted by the French Government, it is not\nperceived on what just ground it can be rejected. A minister will be\nimmediately appointed to proceed to France and resume the negotiation on\nthis and other subjects which may arise between the two nations.</p>\n\n<p>At the proposal of the Russian Imperial Government, made through the\nminister of the Emperor residing here, a full power and instructions have\nbeen transmitted to the minister of the United States at St. Petersburg to\narrange by amicable negotiation the respective rights and interests of the\ntwo nations on the North West coast of this continent. A similar proposal\nhad been made by His Imperial Majesty to the Government of Great Britain,\nwhich has likewise been acceded to. The Government of the United States has\nbeen desirous by this friendly proceeding of manifesting the great value\nwhich they have invariably attached to the friendship of the Emperor and\ntheir solicitude to cultivate the best understanding with his Government.\nIn the discussions to which this interest has given rise and in the\narrangements by which they may terminate the occasion has been judged\nproper for asserting, as a principle in which the rights and interests of\nthe United States are involved, that the American continents, by the free\nand independent condition which they have assumed and maintain, are\nhenceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any\nEuropean powers.</p>\n\n<p>Since the close of the last session of Congress the commissioners and\narbitrators for ascertaining and determining the amount of indemnification\nwhich may be due to citizens of the United States under the decision of His\nImperial Majesty the Emperor of Russia, in conformity to the convention\nconcluded at St. Petersburg on July 12th, 1822, have assembled in this\ncity, and organized themselves as a board for the performance of the\nduties assigned to them by that treaty. The commission constituted under\nthe 11th article of the treaty of February 22nd, 1819, between the United\nStates and Spain is also in session here, and as the term of three years\nlimited by the treaty for the execution of the trust will expire before\nthe period of the next regular meeting of Congress, the attention of the\nLegislature will be drawn to the measures which may be necessary to\naccomplish the objects for which the commission was instituted.</p>\n\n<p>In compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives adopted at\ntheir last session, instructions have been given to all the ministers of\nthe United States accredited to the powers of Europe and America to propose\nthe proscription of the African slave trade by classing it under the\ndenomination, and inflicting on its perpetrators the punishment, of piracy.\nShould this proposal be acceded to, it is not doubted that this odious and\ncriminal practice will be promptly and entirely suppressed. It is earnestly\nhoped that it will be acceded to, from the firm belief that it is the most\neffectual expedient that can be adopted for the purpose.</p>\n\n<p>At the commencement of the recent war between France and Spain it was\ndeclared by the French Government that it would grant no commissions to\nprivateers, and that neither the commerce of Spain herself nor of neutral\nnations should be molested by the naval force of France, except in the\nbreach of a lawful blockade. This declaration, which appears to have been\nfaithfully carried into effect, concurring with principles proclaimed and\ncherished by the United States from the first establishment of their\nindependence, suggested the hope that the time had arrived when the\nproposal for adopting it as a permanent and invariable rule in all future\nmaritime wars might meet the favorable consideration of the great European\npowers. Instructions have accordingly been given to our ministers with\nFrance, Russia, and Great Britain to make those proposals to their\nrespective Governments, and when the friends of humanity reflect on the\nessential amelioration to the condition of the human race which would\nresult from the abolition of private war on the sea and on the great\nfacility by which it might be accomplished, requiring only the consent of a\nfew sovereigns, an earnest hope is indulged that these overtures will meet\nwith an attention animated by the spirit in which they were made, and that\nthey will ultimately be successful.</p>\n\n<p>The ministers who were appointed to the Republics of Colombia and Buenos\nAyres during the last session of Congress proceeded shortly afterwards to\ntheir destinations. Of their arrival there official intelligence has not\nyet been received. The minister appointed to the Republic of Chile will\nsail in a few days. An early appointment will also be made to Mexico. A\nminister has been received from Colombia, and the other Governments have\nbeen informed that ministers, or diplomatic agents of inferior grade, would\nbe received from each, accordingly as they might prefer the one or the\nother.</p>\n\n<p>The minister appointed to Spain proceeded soon after his appointment for\nCadiz, the residence of the Sovereign to whom he was accredited. In\napproaching that port the frigate which conveyed him was warned off by the\ncommander of the French squadron by which it was blockaded and not\npermitted to enter, although apprised by the captain of the frigate of the\npublic character of the person whom he had on board, the landing of whom\nwas the sole object of his proposed entry. This act, being considered an\ninfringement of the rights of ambassadors and of nations, will form a just\ncause of complaint to the Government of France against the officer by whom\nit was committed.</p>\n\n<p>The actual condition of the public finances more than realizes the\nfavorable anticipations that were entertained of it at the opening of the\nlast session of Congress. On the first of January there was a balance in\nthe Treasury of $4,237,427.55. From that time to the 30th of September the\nreceipts amounted to upward of $16.1 millions, and the expenditures to\n$11.4 millions. During the 4th quarter of the year it is estimated that\nthe receipts will at least equal the expenditures, and that there will\nremain in the Treasury on the first day of January next a surplus of\nnearly $9 millions.</p>\n\n<p>On January 1st, 1825, a large amount of the war debt and a part of the\nRevolutionary debt become redeemable. Additional portions of the former\nwill continue to become redeemable annually until the year 1835. it is\nbelieved, however, that if the United States remain at peace the whole of\nthat debt may be redeemed by the ordinary revenue of those years during\nthat period under the provision of the act of March 3rd, 1817, creating the\nsinking fund, and in that case the only part of the debt that will remain\nafter the year 1835 will be the $7 millions of 5% stock subscribed to the\nBank of the United States, and the 3% Revolutionary debt, amounting to\n$13,296,099.06, both of which are redeemable at the pleasure of the\nGovernment.</p>\n\n<p>The state of the Army in its organization and discipline has been gradually\nimproving for several years, and has now attained a high degree of\nperfection. The military disbursements have been regularly made and the\naccounts regularly and promptly rendered for settlement. The supplies of\nvarious descriptions have been of good quality, and regularly issued at all\nof the posts. A system of economy and accountability has been introduced\ninto every branch of the service which admits of little additional\nimprovement. This desirable state has been attained by the act reorganizing\nthe staff of the Army, passed on April 14th, 1818.</p>\n\n<p>The moneys appropriated for fortifications have been regularly and\neconomically applied, and all the works advanced as rapidly as the amount\nappropriated would admit. Three important works will be completed in the\ncourse of this year--that is, Fort Washington, Fort Delaware, and the\nfort at the Rigolets, in Louisiana.</p>\n\n<p>The Board of Engineers and the Topographical Corps have been in constant\nand active service in surveying the coast and projecting the works\nnecessary for its defense.</p>\n\n<p>The Military Academy has attained a degree of perfection in its discipline\nand instruction equal, as is believed, to any institution of its kind in\nany country.</p>\n\n<p>The money appropriated for the use of the Ordnance Department has been\nregularly and economically applied. The fabrication of arms at the national\narmories and by contract with the Department has been gradually improving\nin quality and cheapness. It is believed that their quality is now such as\nto admit of but little improvement.</p>\n\n<p>The completion of the fortifications renders it necessary that there should\nbe a suitable appropriation for the purpose of fabricating the cannon and\ncarriages necessary for those works.</p>\n\n<p>Under the appropriation of $5,000 for exploring the Western waters for the\nlocation of a site for a Western armory, a commission was constituted,\nconsisting of Colonel McRee, Colonel Lee, and Captain Talcott, who have\nbeen engaged in exploring the country. They have not yet reported the\nresult of their labors, but it is believed that they will be prepared to do\nit at an early part of the session of Congress.</p>\n\n<p>During the month of June last General Ashley and his party, who were\ntrading under a license from the Government, were attacked by the Ricarees\nwhile peaceably trading with the Indians at their request. Several of the\nparty were killed and wounded and their property taken or destroyed.</p>\n\n<p>Colonel Leavenworth, who commanded Fort Atkinson, at the Council Bluffs,\nthe most western post, apprehending that the hostile spirit of the Ricarees\nwould extend to other tribes in that quarter, and that thereby the lives of\nthe traders on the Missouri and the peace of the frontier would be\nendangered, took immediate measures to check the evil.</p>\n\n<p>With a detachment of the regiment stationed at the Bluffs he successfully\nattacked the Ricaree village, and it is hoped that such an impression has\nbeen made on them as well as on the other tribes on the Missouri as will\nprevent a recurrence of future hostility.</p>\n\n<p>The report of the Secretary of War, which is herewith transmitted, will\nexhibit in greater detail the condition of the Department in its various\nbranches, and the progress which has been made in its administration during\nthe three first quarters of the year.</p>\n\n<p>I transmit a return of the militia of the several States according to the\nlast reports which have been made by the proper officers in each to the\nDepartment of War. By reference to this return it will be seen that it is\nnot complete, although great exertions have been made to make it so. As the\ndefense and even the liberties of the country must depend in times of\nimminent danger on the militia, it is of the highest importance that it be\nwell organized, armed, and disciplined throughout the Union.</p>\n\n<p>The report of the Secretary of War shews the progress made during the three\nfirst quarters of the present year by the application of the fund\nappropriated for arming the militia. Much difficulty is found in\ndistributing the arms according to the act of Congress providing for it\nfrom the failure of the proper departments in many of the States to make\nregular returns. The act of May 12, 1820 provides that the system of\ntactics and regulations of the various corps of the Regular Army shall be\nextended to the militia. This act has been very imperfectly executed from\nthe want of uniformity in the organization of the militia, proceeding from\nthe defects of the system itself, and especially in its application to that\nmain arm of the public defense. It is thought that this important subject\nin all its branches merits the attention of Congress.</p>\n\n<p>The report of the Secretary of the Navy, which is now communicated,\nfurnishes an account of the administration of that Department for the three\nfirst quarters of the present year, with the progress made in augmenting\nthe Navy, and the manner in which the vessels in commission have been\nemployed.</p>\n\n<p>The usual force has been maintained in the Mediterranean Sea, the Pacific\nOcean, and along the Atlantic coast, and has afforded the necessary\nprotection to our commerce in those seas.</p>\n\n<p>In the West Indies and the Gulf of Mexico our naval force has been\naugmented by the addition of several small vessels provided for by the "act\nauthorizing an additional naval force for the suppression of piracy",\npassed by Congress at their last session. That armament has been eminently\nsuccessful in the accomplishment of its object. The piracies by which our\ncommerce in the neighborhood of the island of Cuba had been afflicted have\nbeen repressed and the confidence of our merchants in a great measure\nrestored.</p>\n\n<p>The patriotic zeal and enterprise of Commodore Porter, to whom the command\nof the expedition was confided, has been fully seconded by the officers and\nmen under his command. And in reflecting with high satisfaction on the\nhonorable manner in which they have sustained the reputation of their\ncountry and its Navy, the sentiment is alloyed only by a concern that in\nthe fulfillment of that arduous service the diseases incident to the season\nand to the climate in which it was discharged have deprived the nation of\nmany useful lives, and among them of several officers of great promise.</p>\n\n<p>In the month of August a very malignant fever made its appearance at\nThompsons Island, which threatened the destruction of our station there.\nMany perished, and the commanding officer was severely attacked. Uncertain\nas to his fate and knowing that most of the medical officers had been\nrendered incapable of discharging their duties, it was thought expedient to\nsend to that post an officer of rank and experience, with several skilled\nsurgeons, to ascertain the origin of the fever and the probability of its\nrecurrence there in future seasons; to furnish every assistance to those\nwho were suffering, and, if practicable, to avoid the necessity of\nabandoning so important a station. Commodore Rodgers, with a promptitude\nwhich did him honor, cheerfully accepted that trust, and has discharged it\nin the manner anticipated from his skill and patriotism. Before his arrival\nCommodore Porter, with the greater part of the squadron, had removed from\nthe island and returned to the United States in consequence of the\nprevailing sickness. Much useful information has, however, been obtained as\nto the state of the island and great relief afforded to those who had been\nnecessarily left there.</p>\n\n<p>Although our expedition, cooperating with an invigorated administration of\nthe government of the island of Cuba, and with the corresponding active\nexertions of a British naval force in the same seas, have almost entirely\ndestroyed the unlicensed piracies from that island, the success of our\nexertions has not been equally effectual to suppress the same crime, under\nother pretenses and colors, in the neighboring island of Porto Rico. They\nhave been committed there under the abusive issue of Spanish commissions.</p>\n\n<p>At an early period of the present year remonstrances were made to the\ngovernor of that island, by an agent who was sent for the purpose, against\nthose outrages on the peaceful commerce of the United States, of which many\nhad occurred. That officer, professing his own want of authority to make\nsatisfaction for our just complaints, answered only by a reference of them\nto the Government of Spain. The minister of the United States to that court\nwas specially instructed to urge the necessity of immediate and effectual\ninterposition of that Government, directing restitution and indemnity for\nwrongs already committed and interdicting the repetition of them. The\nminister, as has been seen, was debarred access to the Spanish Government,\nand in the mean time several new cases of flagrant outrage have occurred,\nand citizens of the United States in the island of Porto Rico have\nsuffered, and others been threatened with assassination for asserting their\nunquestionable rights even before the lawful tribunals of the country.</p>\n\n<p>The usual orders have been given to all our public ships to seize American\nvessels in the slave trade and bring them in for adjudication, and I have\nthe gratification to state that not one so employed has been discovered,\nand there is good reason to believe that our flag is now seldom, if at all,\ndisgraced by that traffic.</p>\n\n<p>It is a source of great satisfaction that we are always enabled to recur to\nthe conduct of our Navy with price and commendation. As a means of national\ndefense it enjoys the public confidence, and is steadily assuming\nadditional importance. It is submitted whether a more efficient and equally\neconomical organization of it might not in several respects be effected. It\nis supposed that higher grades than now exist by law would be useful. They\nwould afford well-merited rewards to those who have long and faithfully\nserved their country, present the best incentives to good conduct, and the\nbest means of insuring a proper discipline; destroy the inequality in that\nrespect between military and naval services, and relieve our officers from\nmany inconveniences and mortifications which occur when our vessels meet\nthose of other nations, ours being the only service in which such grades do\nnot exist.</p>\n\n<p>A report of the Post Master-General, which accompanies this communication,\nwill shew the present state of the Post-Office Department and its general\noperations for some years past.</p>\n\n<p>There is established by law 88,600 miles of post roads, on which the mail\nis now transported 85,700 miles, and contracts have been made for its\ntransportation on all the established routes, with one or two exceptions.\nThere are 5,240 post offices in the Union, and as many post masters. The\ngross amount of postage which accrued from July 1st, 1822 to July 1st,\n1823 was $1,114,345.12. During the same period the expenditures of the\nPost-Office Department amounted to $1,169,885.51 and consisted of the\nfollowing items, viz: Compensation to post masters, $353,995.98;\nincidental expenses, $30,866.37; transportation of the mail, $784,600.08;\npayments into the Treasury, $423.08. On the first of July last there was\ndue to the Department from post masters $135,245.28; from late post\nmasters and contractors, $256,749.31; making a total amount of balances\ndue to the Department of $391,994.59.</p>\n\n<p>These balances embrace all delinquencies of post masters and contractors\nwhich have taken place since the organization of the Department. There was\ndue by the Department to contractors on the first of July last $26,548.64.</p>\n\n<p>The transportation of the mail within five years past has been greatly\nextended, and the expenditures of the Department proportionably increased.\nAlthough the postage which has accrued within the last three years has\nfallen short of the expenditures $262,821.46, it appears that collections\nhave been made from the outstanding balances to meet the principal part of\nthe current demands.</p>\n\n<p>It is estimated that not more than $250,000 of the above balances can be\ncollected, and that a considerable part of this sum can only be realized by\na resort to legal process. Some improvements in the receipts for postage is\nexpected. A prompt attention to the collection of moneys received by post\nmasters, it is believed, will enable the Department to continue its\noperations without aid from the Treasury, unless the expenditures shall be\nincreased by the establishment of new mail routes.</p>\n\n<p>A revision of some parts of the post office law may be necessary; and it is\nsubmitted whether it would not be proper to provide for the appointment of\npost masters, where the compensation exceeds a certain amount, by\nnomination to the Senate, as other officers of the General Government are\nappointed.</p>\n\n<p>Having communicated my views to Congress at the commencement of the last\nsession respecting the encouragement which ought to be given to our\nmanufactures and the principle on which it should be founded, I have only\nto add that those views remain unchanged, and that the present state of\nthose countries with which we have the most immediate political relations\nand greatest commercial intercourse tends to confirm them. Under this\nimpression I recommend a review of the tariff for the purpose of affording\nsuch additional protection to those articles which we are prepared to\nmanufacture, or which are more immediately connected with the defense and\nindependence of the country.</p>\n\n<p>The actual state of the public accounts furnishes additional evidence of\nthe efficiency of the present system of accountability in relation to the\npublic expenditure. Of the moneys drawn from the Treasury since\nMarch 4th, 1817, the sum remaining unaccounted for on the 30th of September\nlast is more than $1.5 millions less than on the 30th of September\npreceding; and during the same period a reduction of nearly $1 million\nhas been made in the amount of the unsettled accounts for moneys advanced\npreviously to March 4th, 1817. It will be obvious that in proportion as\nthe mass of accounts of the latter description is diminished by settlement\nthe difficulty of settling the residue is increased from the consideration\nthat in many instances it can be obtained only by legal process. For more\nprecise details on this subject I refer to a report from the first\nComptroller of the Treasury.</p>\n\n<p>The sum which was appropriated at the last session for the repairs of the\nCumberland road has been applied with good effect to that object. A final\nreport has not been received from the agent who was appointed to\nsuperintend it. As soon as it is received it shall be communicated to\nCongress.</p>\n\n<p>Many patriotic and enlightened citizens who have made the subject an object\nof particular investigation have suggested an improvement of still greater\nimportance. They are of the opinion that the waters of the Chesapeake and\nOhio may be connected together by one continued canal, and at an expense\nfar short of the value and importance of the object to be obtained. If this\ncould be accomplished it is impossible to calculate the beneficial\nconsequences which would result from it.</p>\n\n<p>A great portion of the produce of the very fertile country through which it\nwould pass would find a market through that channel. Troops might be moved\nwith great facility in war, with cannon and every kind of munition, and in\neither direction. Connecting the Atlantic with the Western country in a\nline passing through the seat of the National Government, it would\ncontribute essentially to strengthen the bond of union itself.</p>\n\n<p>Believing as I do that Congress possess the right to appropriate money for\nsuch a national object (the jurisdiction remaining to the States through\nwhich the canal would pass), I submit it to your consideration whether it\nmay not be advisable to authorize by an adequate appropriation the\nemployment of a suitable number of the officers of the Corps of Engineers\nto examine the unexplored ground during the next season and to report their\nopinion thereon. It will likewise be proper to extend their examination to\nthe several routes through which the waters of the Ohio may be connected by\ncanals with those of Lake Erie.</p>\n\n<p>As the Cumberland road will require annual repairs, and Congress have not\nthought it expedient to recommend to the States an amendment to the\nConstitution for the purpose of vesting in the United States a power to\nadopt and execute a system of internal improvement, it is also submitted to\nyour consideration whether it may not be expedient to authorize the\nExecutive to enter into an arrangement with the several States through\nwhich the road passes to establish tolls, each within its limits, for the\npurpose of defraying the expense of future repairs and of providing also by\nsuitable penalties for its protection against future injuries.</p>\n\n<p>The act of Congress of May 7th, 1822, appropriated the sum of $22,700 for\nthe purpose of erecting two piers as a shelter for vessels from ice near\nCape Henlopen, Delaware Bay. To effect the object of the act the officers\nof the Board of Engineers, with Commodore Bainbridge, were directed to\nprepare plans and estimates of piers sufficient to answer the purpose\nintended by the act. It appears by their report, which accompanies the\ndocuments from the War Department, that the appropriation is not adequate\nto the purpose intended; and as the piers would be of great service both to\nthe navigation of the Delaware Bay and the protection of vessels on the\nadjacent parts of the coast, I submit for the consideration of Congress\nwhether additional and sufficient appropriations should not be made.</p>\n\n<p>The Board of Engineers were also directed to examine and survey the\nentrance of the harbor of the port of Presqu\'isle, in Pennsylvania, in\norder to make an estimate of the expense of removing the obstructions\nto the entrance, with a plan of the best mode of effecting the same, under\nthe appropriation for that purpose by act of Congress passed 3rd of March\nlast. The report of the Board accompanies the papers from the War\nDepartment, and is submitted for the consideration of Congress.</p>\n\n<p>A strong hope has been long entertained, founded on the heroic struggle of\nthe Greeks, that they would succeed in their contest and resume their equal\nstation among the nations of the earth. It is believed that the whole\ncivilized world take a deep interest in their welfare. Although no power\nhas declared in their favor, yet none according to our information, has\ntaken part against them. Their cause and their name have protected them\nfrom dangers which might ere this have overwhelmed any other people. The\nordinary calculations of interest and of acquisition with a view to\naggrandizement, which mingles so much in the transactions of nations, seem\nto have had no effect in regard to them. From the facts which have come to\nour knowledge there is good cause to believe that their enemy has lost\nforever all dominion over them; that Greece will become again an\nindependent nation. That she may obtain that rank is the object of our most\nardent wishes.</p>\n\n<p>It was stated at the commencement of the last session that a great effort\nwas then making in Spain and Portugal to improve the condition of the\npeople of those countries, and that it appeared to be conducted with\nextraordinary moderation. It need scarcely be remarked that the result has\nbeen so far very different from what was then anticipated. Of events in\nthat quarter of the globe, with which we have so much intercourse and from\nwhich we derive our origin, we have always been anxious and interested\nspectators.</p>\n\n<p>The citizens of the United States cherish sentiments the most friendly in\nfavor of the liberty and happiness of their fellow men on that side of the\nAtlantic. In the wars of the European powers in matters relating to\nthemselves we have never taken any part, nor does it comport with our\npolicy so to do.</p>\n\n<p>It is only when our rights are invaded or seriously menaced that we resent\ninjuries or make preparation for our defense. With the movements in this\nhemisphere we are of necessity more immediately connected, and by causes\nwhich must be obvious to all enlightened and impartial observers.</p>\n\n<p>The political system of the allied powers is essentially different in this\nrespect from that of America. This difference proceeds from that which\nexists in their respective Governments; and to the defense of our own,\nwhich has been achieved by the loss of so much blood and treasure, and\nmatured by the wisdom of their most enlightened citizens, and under which\nwe have enjoyed unexampled felicity, this whole nation is devoted.</p>\n\n<p>We owe it, therefore, to candor and to the amicable relations existing\nbetween the United States and those powers to declare that we should\nconsider any attempt on their part to extend their system to any portion of\nthis hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety. With the existing\ncolonies or dependencies of any European power we have not interfered and\nshall not interfere, but with the Governments who have declared their\nindependence and maintained it, and whose independence we have, on great\nconsideration and on just principles, acknowledged, we could not view any\ninterposition for the purpose of oppressing them, or controlling in any\nother manner their destiny, by any European power in any other light than\nas the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United\nStates.</p>\n\n<p>In the war between those new Governments and Spain we declared our\nneutrality at the time of their recognition, and to this we have adhered,\nand shall continue to adhere, provided no change shall occur which, in the\njudgment of the competent authorities of this Government, shall make a\ncorresponding change on the part of the United States indispensable to\ntheir security.</p>\n\n<p>The late events in Spain and Portugal shew that Europe is still unsettled.\nOf this important fact no stronger proof can be adduced than that the\nallied powers should have thought it proper, on any principle satisfactory\nto themselves, to have interposed by force in the internal concerns of\nSpain. To what extent such interposition may be carried, on the same\nprinciple, is a question in which all independent powers whose governments\ndiffer from theirs are interested, even those most remote, and surely none\nmore so than the United States.</p>\n\n<p>Our policy in regard to Europe, which was adopted at an early stage of the\nwars which have so long agitated that quarter of the globe, nevertheless\nremains the same, which is, not to interfere in the internal concerns of\nany of its powers; to consider the government de facto as the legitimate\ngovernment for us; to cultivate friendly relations with it, and to preserve\nthose relations by a frank, firm, and manly policy, meeting in all\ninstances the just claims of every power, submitting to injuries from\nnone.</p>\n\n<p>But in regard to those continents circumstances are eminently and\nconspicuously different. It is impossible that the allied powers should\nextend their political system to any portion of either continent without\nendangering our peace and happiness; nor can anyone believe that our\nsouthern brethren, if left to themselves, would adopt it of their own\naccord. It is equally impossible, therefore, that we should behold such\ninterposition in any form with indifference. If we look to the comparative\nstrength and resources of Spain and those new Governments, and their\ndistance from each other, it must be obvious that she can never subdue\nthem. It is still the true policy of the United States to leave the parties\nto themselves, in the hope that other powers will pursue the same course.</p>\n\n<p>If we compare the present condition of our Union with its actual state at\nthe close of our Revolution, the history of the world furnishes no example\nof a progress in improvement in all the important circumstances which\nconstitute the happiness of a nation which bears any resemblance to it. At\nthe first epoch our population did not exceed 3,000,000. By the last census\nit amounted to about 10,000,000, and, what is more extraordinary, it is\nalmost altogether native, for the immigration from other countries has been\ninconsiderable.</p>\n\n<p>At the first epoch half the territory within our acknowledged limits was\nuninhabited and a wilderness. Since then new territory has been acquired of\nvast extent, comprising within it many rivers, particularly the\nMississippi, the navigation of which to the ocean was of the highest\nimportance to the original States. Over this territory our population has\nexpanded in every direction, and new States have been established almost\nequal in number to those which formed the first bond of our Union. This\nexpansion of our population and accession of new States to our Union have\nhad the happiest effect on all its highest interests.</p>\n\n<p>That it has eminently augmented our resources and added to our strength and\nrespectability as a power is admitted by all, but it is not in these\nimportant circumstances only that this happy effect is felt. It is manifest\nthat by enlarging the basis of our system and increasing the number of\nStates the system itself has been greatly strengthened in both its\nbranches. Consolidation and disunion have thereby been rendered equally\nimpracticable.</p>\n\n<p>Each Government, confiding in its own strength, has less to apprehend from\nthe other, and in consequence each, enjoying a greater freedom of action,\nis rendered more efficient for all the purposes for which it was\ninstituted.</p>\n\n<p>It is unnecessary to treat here of the vast improvement made in the system\nitself by the adoption of this Constitution and of its happy effect in\nelevating the character and in protecting the rights of the nation as well\nas individuals. To what, then, do we owe these blessings? It is known to\nall that we derive them from the excellence of our institutions. Ought we\nnot, then, to adopt every measure which may be necessary to perpetuate\nthem?\n</p>\n\t\t\t<div class="textNav"><a href="#top">^ Return to top</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>\n\t<div id="footer"><strong><em>State of the Union</em></strong> is a project\n\t\tby Brad Borevitz at <a href="http://www.onetwothree.net">onetwothree.net</a></div>\n</div>\n<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">\n</script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n_uacct = "UA-410742-1";\nurchinTracker();\n</script>\n</body>\n<!-- InstanceEnd -->\n</html>\n'
