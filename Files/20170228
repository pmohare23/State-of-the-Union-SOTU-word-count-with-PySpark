Trump</h2>\n\t\t\t<h3>February 28, 2017</h3>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p>\nThank you very much. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of\nCongress, the first lady of the United States ...</p>\n\n<p>... and citizens of America, tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our\ncelebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our nation\'s path\ntoward civil rights and the work that still remains to be done.</p>\n\n<p>Recent threats ...</p>\n\n<p>Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of\nJewish cemeteries, as well as last week\'s shooting in Kansas City,\nremind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a\ncountry that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its\nvery ugly forms.</p>\n\n<p>Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice,\nin an unbroken chain all the way down to the present. That torch is now\nin our hands. And we will use it to light up the world.</p>\n\n<p>I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is\na message deeply delivered from my heart. A new chapter ...</p>\n\n<p>... of American greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is\nsweeping across our nation. And a new surge of optimism is placing\nimpossible dreams firmly within our grasp. What we are witnessing today\nis the renewal of the American spirit. Our allies will find that America\nis once again ready to lead.</p>\n\n<p>All the nations of the world  friend or foe  will find that America is\nstrong, America is proud, and America is free. In nine years, the United\nStates will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding, 250 years\nsince the day we declared our independence. It will be one of the great\nmilestones in the history of the world.</p>\n\n<p>But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of\ncountry will we leave for our children? I will not allow the mistakes of\nrecent decades past to define the course of our future.</p>\n\n<p>For too long, we\'ve watched our middle class shrink as we\'ve exported\nour jobs and wealth to foreign countries. We\'ve financed and built one\nglobal project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in\nthe inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit and so many other places\nthroughout our land.</p>\n\n<p>We\'ve defended the borders of other nations while leaving our own\nborders wide open for anyone to cross, and for drugs to pour in at a now\nunprecedented rate. And we\'ve spent trillions and trillions of dollars\noverseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.</p>\n\n<p>Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started\nas a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds,\nfamilies who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair\nhearing for their concerns.</p>\n\n<p>But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus, as thousands of citizens\nnow spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our\ncountry.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by\nthe tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but\ncrucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first, because\nonly then can we truly make America great again.</p>\n\n<p>Dying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic veterans will\nget the care they so desperately need. Our military will be given the\nresources its brave warriors so richly deserve.</p>\n\n<p>Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges,\ntunnels, airports and railways, gleaming across our very, very beautiful\nland. Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately stop. And\nour neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety and\nopportunity.</p>\n\n<p>Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you. It\'s been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I\nwant to take this moment to update the nation on the progress I\'ve made\nin keeping those promises. Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler,\nGeneral Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart and many\nothers have announced that they will invest billions and billions of\ndollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new\nAmerican jobs.</p>\n\n<p>The stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the\nelection on Nov. 8, a record. We\'ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions\nof dollars by bringing down the price of fantastic  and it is a\nfantastic  new F-35 jet fighter, and we\'ll be saving billions more on\ncontracts all across our government.</p>\n\n<p>We have placed a hiring freeze on nonmilitary and nonessential federal\nworkers.</p>\n\n<p>We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a\nfive-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials  and a lifetime\nban ...</p>\n\n<p>Thank you. Thank you. And a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a\nforeign government. We have undertaken a historic effort to massively\nreduce job-crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force\ninside of every government agency ...</p>\n\n<p>... and we\'re imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one new\nregulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.</p>\n\n<p>We\'re going to stop the regulations that threaten the future and\nlivelihood of our great coal miners.</p>\n\n<p>We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota\nAccess Pipelines ...</p>\n\n<p>... thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs. And I\'ve issued a new\ndirective that new American pipelines be made with American steel.</p>\n\n<p>We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific\nPartnership.</p>\n\n<p>And with the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a\ncouncil with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women\nentrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need\nto start a business and live out their financial dreams.</p>\n\n<p>To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to\nform a task force on reducing violent crime. I have further ordered the\nDepartments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department\nof State and the director of national intelligence, to coordinate an\naggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread\nall across our nation.</p>\n\n<p>We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our\nyouth, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly\naddicted.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the\nAmerican people for immigration enforcement and border security.</p>\n\n<p>By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the\nunemployed, save billions and billions of dollars, and make our\ncommunities safer for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>We want all Americans to succeed, but that can\'t happen in an\nenvironment of lawless chaos.</p>\n\n<p>We must restore integrity and the rule of law at our borders.</p>\n\n<p>For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great\nwall along our southern border.</p>\n\n<p>As we speak tonight, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and\ncriminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent\ncitizens. Bad ones are going out as I speak, and as I promised\nthroughout the campaign. To any in Congress who do not believe we should\nenforce our laws, I would ask you this one question: What would you say\nto the American family that loses their jobs, their income or their\nloved one because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its\nborders?</p>\n\n<p>Our obligation is to serve, protect and defend the citizens of the\nUnited States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our nation\nfrom radical Islamic terrorism.</p>\n\n<p>According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast\nmajority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related\noffenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen\nthe attacks at home, from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and,\nyes, even the World Trade Center. We have seen the attacks in France, in\nBelgium, in Germany and all over the world.</p>\n\n<p>It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from\nplaces where proper vetting cannot occur.</p>\n\n<p>Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should\nsupport this country and love its people and its values. We cannot allow\na beachhead of terrorism to form inside America, and we cannot allow our\nnation to become a sanctuary for extremists.</p>\n\n<p>That is why my administration has been working on improved vetting\nprocedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe,\nand to keep those out who will do us harm.</p>\n\n<p>As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to\ndemolish and destroy ISIS, a network of lawless savages that have\nslaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women and children of all\nfaiths and all beliefs. We will work with our allies, including our\nfriends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy\nfrom our planet.</p>\n\n<p>I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who\nsupport Iran\'s ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable\nalliance with the state of Israel.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a justice to the United\nStates Supreme Court, from my list of 20 judges, who will defend our\nConstitution.</p>\n\n<p>I am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery\ntonight.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you, Maureen. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will\nforever be a symbol of American justice.</p>\n\n<p>To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible\nskill and deep devotion to the law. He was confirmed unanimously by the\nCourt of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his\nnomination.</p>\n\n<p>Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must\nhonestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited. Ninety-four million\nAmericans are out of the labor force. Over 43 million people are now\nliving in poverty. And over 43 million Americans are on food stamps.</p>\n\n<p>More than one in five people in their prime working years are not\nworking. We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years. In the last\neight years, the past administration has put on more new debt than\nnearly all of the other presidents combined.</p>\n\n<p>We\'ve lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since Nafta\nwas approved, and we\'ve lost 60,000 factories since China joined the\nWorld Trade Organization in 2001. Our trade deficit in goods with the\nworld last year was nearly $800 billion. And overseas, we have inherited\na series of tragic foreign policy disasters.</p>\n\n<p>Solving these and so many other pressing problems will require us to\nwork past the differences of party. It will require us to tap into the\nAmerican spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long\nand storied history. But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we\nmust restart the engine of the American economy, making it easier for\ncompanies to do business in the United States and much, much harder for\ncompanies to leave our country.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates\nanywhere in the world. My economic team is developing historic tax\nreform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can\ncompete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.</p>\n\n<p>It will be a big, big cut.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle\nclass. We must create a level playing field for American companies and\nour workers  have to do it.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries\nmake us pay very high tariffs and taxes, but when foreign companies ship\ntheir products into America, we charge them nothing or almost nothing.</p>\n\n<p>I just met with officials and workers from a great American company,\nHarley-Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their\nmagnificent motorcycles, made in the U.S.A., on the front lawn of the\nWhite House.</p>\n\n<p>And they wanted me to ride one, and I said, "No, thank you."</p>\n\n<p>At our meeting, I asked them, "How are you doing? How is business?" They\nsaid that it\'s good. I asked them further, "How are you doing with other\ncountries, mainly international sales?"</p>\n\n<p>They told me  without even complaining, because they have been so\nmistreated for so long that they\'ve become used to it  that it\'s very\nhard to do business with other countries, because they tax our goods at\nsuch a high rate. They said that in the case of another country, they\ntaxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.</p>\n\n<p>They weren\'t even asking for a change. But I am. I believe ...</p>\n\n<p>I believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade. It\'s\nbeen a long time since we had fair trade.</p>\n\n<p>The first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, warned that "the\nabandonment of the protective policy by the American government will\nproduce want and ruin among our people."</p>\n\n<p>Lincoln was right, and it\'s time we heeded his advice and his words.</p>\n\n<p>I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be\ntaken  advantage of us any longer. They have taken advantage of our\ncountry no longer.</p>\n\n<p>I am going to bring back millions of jobs. Protecting our workers also\nmeans reforming our system of legal immigration.</p>\n\n<p>The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers and\nputs great pressure on taxpayers. Nations around the world, like Canada,\nAustralia and many others, have a merit-based immigration system.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be\nable to support themselves financially. Yet in America we do not enforce\nthis rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens\nrely upon.</p>\n\n<p>According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration\nsystem costs American taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.\nSwitching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration,\nand instead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more\nbenefits. It will save countless dollars, raise workers\' wages and help\nstruggling families, including immigrant families, enter the middle\nclass. And they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy,\nindeed.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long\nas we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for\nAmericans, to strengthen our nation\'s security and to restore respect\nfor our laws.</p>\n\n<p>If we are guided by the well-being of American citizens, then I believe\nRepublicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that\nhas eluded our country for decades.</p>\n\n<p>Another Republican president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last\ntruly great national infrastructure program: the building of the\ninterstate highway system. The time has come for a new program of\nnational rebuilding.</p>\n\n<p>America has spent approximately $6 trillion in the Middle East, all the\nwhile our infrastructure at home is crumbling.</p>\n\n<p>With the $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice, and maybe\neven three times, if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.</p>\n\n<p>To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve\nlegislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of\nthe United States, financed through both public and private capital,\ncreating millions of new jobs.</p>\n\n<p>This effort will be guided by two core principles: Buy American and hire\nAmerican.</p>\n\n<p>Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace\nObamacare ...</p>\n\n<p>... with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs and at\nthe same time provide better health care.</p>\n\n<p>Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was\nnever the right solution for our country.</p>\n\n<p>The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the\ncost of health insurance, and that is what we are going to do.</p>\n\n<p>Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple\ndigits. As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone. Gov.\nMatt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his state, the\nstate of Kentucky, and it\'s unsustainable and collapsing.</p>\n\n<p>One third of the counties have only one insurer, and they\'re losing them\nfast, they are losing them so fast. They\'re leaving. And many Americans\nhave no choice at all. There\'s no choice left.</p>\n\n<p>Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor and keep\nyour plan? We now know that all of those promises have been totally\nbroken. Obamacare is collapsing, and we must act decisively to protect\nall Americans.</p>\n\n<p>Action is not a choice; it is a necessity. So I am calling on all\nDemocrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans\nfrom this imploding Obamacare disaster.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the principles that should guide Congress as we move to create\na better health care system for all Americans.</p>\n\n<p>First, we should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have\naccess to coverage and that we have a stable transition for Americans\ncurrently enrolled in the health care exchanges.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through\nthe use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts, but it must\nbe the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our government.</p>\n\n<p>Thirdly, we should give our state governors the resources and\nflexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and\ndoctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance and\nwork to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them\ndown immediately.</p>\n\n<p>And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase\nhealth insurance across state lines ...</p>\n\n<p>... which will create a truly competitive national marketplace that will\nbring costs way down and provide far better care. So important.</p>\n\n<p>Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can\nbe solved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope. Our\ncitizens deserve this, and so much more, so why not join forces and\nfinally get the job done and get it done right?</p>\n\n<p>On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get\ntogether and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the\nAmerican people.</p>\n\n<p>My administration wants to work with members of both parties to make\nchild care accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents that\nthey have paid family leave ...</p>\n\n<p>... to invest in women\'s health, and to promote clean air and clean\nwater, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance\nthe common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who\ndeserves a much brighter future.</p>\n\n<p>An incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an\ninspiration to us all. Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the\ngallery is a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley. Megan ...</p>\n\n<p>Megan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when\nshe was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5. On receiving\nthis news, Megan\'s dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the\nlife of his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure and\nhelped develop the drug that saved Megan\'s life. Today she is 20 years\nold and a sophomore at Notre Dame.</p>\n\n<p>Megan\'s story is about the unbounded power of a father\'s love for a\ndaughter. But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and\nDrug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved\nMegan\'s life, from reaching those in need.</p>\n\n<p>If we slash the restraints, not just at the F.D.A. but across our\ngovernment, then we will be blessed with far more miracles just like\nMegan.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, our children will grow up in a nation of miracles. But to\nachieve this future, we must enrich the mind  and the souls  of every\nAmerican child. Education is the civil rights issue of our time.</p>\n\n<p>I am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that\nfunds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of\nAfrican-American and Latino children.</p>\n\n<p>These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter,\nmagnet, religious or home school that is right for them.</p>\n\n<p>Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha\nMerriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed\nthird grade twice. But then she was able to enroll in a private center\nfor learning  great learning center  with the help of a tax credit and a\nscholarship program. Today, she is the first in her family to graduate,\nnot just from high school, but from college. Later this year, she will\nget her master\'s degree in social work. We want all children to be able\nto break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.</p>\n\n<p>But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of\nviolence. The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year\nincrease in nearly half a century. In Chicago, more than 4,000 people\nwere shot last year alone, and the murder rate so far this year has been\neven higher. This is not acceptable in our society.</p>\n\n<p>Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to\nattend a great school and to have access to a high-paying job.</p>\n\n<p>But to create this future, we must work with  not against  not against \nthe men and women of law enforcement.</p>\n\n<p>We must build bridges of cooperation and trust, not drive the wedge of\ndisunity and it\'s  really, it\'s what it is, division. It\'s pure,\nunadulterated division. We have to unify. Police and sheriffs are\nmembers of our community. They\'re friends and neighbors, they\'re mothers\nand fathers, sons and daughters, and they leave behind loved ones every\nday who worry about whether or not they\'ll come home safe and sound. We\nmust support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.</p>\n\n<p>And we must support the victims of crime. I have ordered the Department\nof Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims. The\noffice is called Voice, Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement.</p>\n\n<p>We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and\nsilenced by special interests. Joining us ...</p>\n\n<p>Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose\ngovernment failed them. Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna\nOliver and Jessica Davis. Jamiel\'s 17-year-old son was viciously\nmurdered by an illegal immigrant gang member who had just been released\nfrom prison. Jamiel Shaw Jr. was an incredible young man with unlimited\npotential who was getting ready to go to college, where he would have\nexcelled as a great college quarterback.</p>\n\n<p>But he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight,\nhas become a very good friend of mine. Jamiel, thank you. Thank you.</p>\n\n<p>Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands  Deputy\nSheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis  were slain in the line\nof duty in California. They were pillars of their community. These brave\nmen were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal\nrecord and two prior deportations. Should have never been in our\ncountry.</p>\n\n<p>Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna, I want you to know\nthat your father was a hero and that tonight you have the love of an\nentire country supporting you and praying for you.</p>\n\n<p>To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica, I want you to know that we will\nnever stop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never, ever be\nforgotten. We will always honor their memory.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the\nUnited States military with the tools they need to prevent war  if they\nmust  they have to fight and they only have to win.</p>\n\n<p>I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates\nthe defense sequester...</p>\n\n<p>... and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense\nspending in American history.</p>\n\n<p>My budget will also increase funding for our veterans. Our veterans have\ndelivered for this nation, and now we must deliver for them.</p>\n\n<p>The challenges we face as a nation are great. But our people are even\ngreater. And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America\nin uniform.</p>\n\n<p>We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of U.S.\nNavy special operator, Senior Chief William "Ryan" Owens. Ryan died as\nhe lived, a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing\nour nation.</p>\n\n<p>I just spoke to our great General [Jim] Mattis just now who reconfirmed\nthat, and I quote, "Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that\ngenerated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many\nmore victories in the future against our enemy."</p>\n\n<p>Ryan\'s legacy is etched into eternity. Thank you.</p>\n\n<p>And Ryan is looking down right now. You know that. And he\'s very happy,\nbecause I think he just broke a record.</p>\n\n<p>For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay\ndown one\'s life for one\'s friends. Ryan laid down his life for his\nfriends, for his country and for our freedom. And we will never forget\nRyan.</p>\n\n<p>To those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look\nno further than the heroes who wear our uniform. Our foreign policy\ncalls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world. It\nis American leadership based on vital security interests that we share\nwith our allies all across the globe.</p>\n\n<p>We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two\nworld wars, that dethroned fascism ...</p>\n\n<p>... and a Cold War and defeated communism.</p>\n\n<p>But our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based\non our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just\nthat. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice.</p>\n\n<p>We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East or in the\nPacific, to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and\nmilitary operations, and pay their fair share of the cost  have to do\nthat.</p>\n\n<p>We will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign\nrights of all nations. And they have to respect our rights as a nation,\nalso.</p>\n\n<p>Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people,\nand America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path.\nMy job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United\nStates of America.</p>\n\n<p>But we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not\nmore. We must learn from the mistakes of the past. We have seen the war\nand the destruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world.\nAll across the world.</p>\n\n<p>The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in many\ncases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely\nreturn home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding.</p>\n\n<p>America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships,\nwhere shared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and\nconflict. We want peace, wherever peace can be found. America is friends\ntoday with former enemies. Some of our closest allies, decades ago,\nfought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars. This\nhistory should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better\nworld.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more\npeaceful, more just, and more free.</p>\n\n<p>On our 100th anniversary in 1876, citizens from across our nation came\nto Philadelphia to celebrate America\'s centennial. At that celebration,\nthe country\'s builders and artists and inventors showed off their\nwonderful creations. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for\nthe first time. Remington unveiled the first typewriter. An early\nattempt was made at electric light. Thomas Edison showed an automatic\ntelegraph and an electric pen. Imagine the wonders our country could\nknow in America\'s 250th year.</p>\n\n<p>Think of the marvels we could achieve if we simply set free the dreams\nof our people. Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are\nnot too much to hope. American footprints on distant worlds are not too\nbig a dream. Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to\nexpect. And streets where mothers are safe from fear  schools where\nchildren learn in peace, and jobs where Americans prosper and grow  are\nnot too much to ask.</p>\n\n<p>When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever\nbefore, for all Americans. This is our vision. This is our mission. But\nwe can only get there together. We are one people, with one destiny.</p>\n\n<p>We all bleed the same blood. We all salute the same great American flag.\nAnd we are all made by the same God.</p>\n\n<p>When we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious\nfreedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of\nAmerican greatness began. The time for small thinking is over. The time\nfor trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the\ndreams that fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir\nour souls, and the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into\naction.</p>\n\n<p>From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened\nby our fears, inspired by the future, not bound by failures of the past,\nand guided by a vision, not blinded by our doubts.</p>\n\n<p>I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit.\nI am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold\nand daring things for our country. I am asking everyone watching tonight\nto seize this moment. Believe in yourselves. Believe in your future. And\nbelieve, once more, in America.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States.\n</p>\n\t\t\t<div class="textNav"><a href="#top">^ Return to top</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>\n\t<div id="footer"><strong><em>State of the Union</em></strong> is a project\n\t\tby Brad Borevitz at <a href="http://www.onetwothree.net">onetwothree.net</a></div>\n</div>\n<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">\n</script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n_uacct = "UA-410742-1";\nurchinTracker();\n</script>\n</body>\n<!-- InstanceEnd -->\n</html>\n'
