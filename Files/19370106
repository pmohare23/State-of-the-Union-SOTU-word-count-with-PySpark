Roosevelt</h2>\n\t\t\t<h3>January 6, 1937</h3>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p>\nMr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Congress of the United States:</p>\n\n<p>For the first time in our national history a President delivers his Annual\nMessage to a new Congress within a fortnight of the expiration of his term\nof office. While there is no change in the Presidency this year, change\nwill occur in future years. It is my belief that under this new\nconstitutional practice, the President should in every fourth year, in so\nfar as seems reasonable, review the existing state of our national affairs\nand outline broad future problems, leaving specific recommendations for\nfuture legislation to be made by the President about to be inaugurated.</p>\n\n<p>At this time, however, circumstances of the moment compel me to ask your\nimmediate consideration of: First, measures extending the life of certain\nauthorizations and powers which, under present statutes, expire within a\nfew weeks; second, an addition to the existing Neutrality Act to cover\nspecific points raised by the unfortunate civil strife in Spain; and,\nthird, a deficiency appropriation bill for which I shall submit estimates\nthis week.</p>\n\n<p>In March, 1933, the problems which faced our Nation and which only our\nnational Government had the resources to meet were more serious even than\nappeared on the surface.</p>\n\n<p>It was not only that the visible mechanism of economic life had broken\ndown. More disturbing was the fact that long neglect of the needs of the\nunderprivileged had brought too many of our people to the verge of doubt as\nto the successful adaptation of our historic traditions to the complex\nmodern world. In that lay a challenge to our democratic form of Government\nitself.</p>\n\n<p>Ours was the task to prove that democracy could be made to function in the\nworld of today as effectively as in the simpler world of a hundred years\nago. Ours was the task to do more than to argue a theory. The times\nrequired the confident answer of performance to those whose instinctive\nfaith in humanity made them want to believe that in the long run democracy\nwould prove superior to more extreme forms of Government as a process of\ngetting action when action was wisdom, without the spiritual sacrifices\nwhich those other forms of Government exact.</p>\n\n<p>That challenge we met. To meet it required unprecedented activities under\nFederal leadership to end abuses, to restore a large measure of material\nprosperity, to give new faith to millions of our citizens who had been\ntraditionally taught to expect that democracy would provide continuously\nwider opportunity and continuously greater security in a world where\nscience was continuously making material riches more available to man.</p>\n\n<p>In the many methods of attack with which we met these problems, you and I,\nby mutual understanding and by determination to cooperate, helped to make\ndemocracy succeed by refusing to permit unnecessary disagreement to arise\nbetween two of our branches of Government. That spirit of cooperation was\nable to solve difficulties of extraordinary magnitude and ramification with\nfew important errors, and at a cost cheap when measured by the immediate\nnecessities and the eventual results.</p>\n\n<p>I look forward to a continuance of that cooperation in the next four years.\nI look forward also to a continuance of the basis of that cooperation--\nmutual respect for each other\'s proper sphere of functioning in a democracy\nwhich is working well, and a common-sense realization of the need for play\nin the joints of the machine.</p>\n\n<p>On that basis, it is within the right of the Congress to determine which of\nthe many new activities shall be continued or abandoned, increased or\ncurtailed.</p>\n\n<p>On that same basis, the President alone has the responsibility for their\nadministration. I find that this task of Executive management has reached\nthe point where our administrative machinery needs comprehensive\noverhauling. I shall, therefore, shortly address the Congress more fully in\nregard to modernizing and improving the Executive branch of the\nGovernment.</p>\n\n<p>That cooperation of the past four years between the Congress and the\nPresident has aimed at the fulfillment of a twofold policy: first, economic\nrecovery through many kinds of assistance to agriculture, industry and\nbanking; and, second, deliberate improvement in the personal security and\nopportunity of the great mass of our people.</p>\n\n<p>The recovery we sought was not to be merely temporary. It was to be a\nrecovery protected from the causes of previous disasters. With that aim in\nview--to prevent a future similar crisis--you and I joined in a series of\nenactments--safe banking and sound currency, the guarantee of bank deposits,\nprotection for the investor in securities, the removal of the threat of\nagricultural surpluses, insistence on collective bargaining, the outlawing\nof sweat shops, child labor and unfair trade practices, and the beginnings\nof security for the aged and the worker.</p>\n\n<p>Nor was the recovery we sought merely a purposeless whirring of machinery.\nIt is important, of course, that every man and woman in the country be able\nto find work, that every factory run, that business and farming as a whole\nearn profits. But Government in a democratic Nation does not exist solely,\nor even primarily, for that purpose.</p>\n\n<p>It is not enough that the wheels turn. They must carry us in the direction\nof a greater satisfaction in life for the average man. The deeper purpose\nof democratic government is to assist as many of its citizens as possible,\nespecially those who need it most, to improve their conditions of life, to\nretain all personal liberty which does not adversely affect their\nneighbors, and to pursue the happiness which comes with security and an\nopportunity for recreation and culture.</p>\n\n<p>Even with our present recovery we are far from the goal of that deeper\npurpose. There are far-reaching problems still with us for which democracy\nmust find solutions if it is to consider itself successful.</p>\n\n<p>For example, many millions of Americans still live in habitations which not\nonly fail to provide the physical benefits of modern civilization but breed\ndisease and impair the health of future generations. The menace exists not\nonly in the slum areas of the very large cities, but in many smaller cities\nas well. It exists on tens of thousands of farms, in varying degrees, in\nevery part of the country.</p>\n\n<p>Another example is the prevalence of an un-American type of tenant farming.\nI do not suggest that every farm family has the capacity to earn a\nsatisfactory living on its own farm. But many thousands of tenant farmers,\nindeed most of them, with some financial assistance and with some advice\nand training, can be made self-supporting on land which can eventually\nbelong to them. The Nation would be wise to offer them that chance instead\nof permitting them to go along as they do now, year after year, with\nneither future security as tenants nor hope of ownership of their homes nor\nexpectation of bettering the lot of their children.</p>\n\n<p>Another national problem is the intelligent development of our social\nsecurity system, the broadening of the services it renders, and practical\nimprovement in its operation. In many Nations where such laws are in\neffect, success in meeting the expectations of the community has come\nthrough frequent amendment of the original statute.</p>\n\n<p>And, of course, the most far-reaching and the most inclusive problem of all\nis that of unemployment and the lack of economic balance of which\nunemployment is at once the result and the symptom. The immediate question\nof adequate relief for the needy unemployed who are capable of performing\nuseful work, I shall discuss with the Congress during the coming months.\nThe broader task of preventing unemployment is a matter of long-range\nevolutionary policy. To that we must continue to give our best thought and\neffort. We cannot assume that immediate industrial and commercial activity\nwhich mitigates present pressures justifies the national Government at this\ntime in placing the unemployment problem in a filing cabinet of finished\nbusiness.</p>\n\n<p>Fluctuations in employment are tied to all other wasteful fluctuations in\nour mechanism of production and distribution. One of these wastes is\nspeculation. In securities or commodities, the larger the volume of\nspeculation, the wider become the upward and downward swings and the more\ncertain the result that in the long run there will be more losses than\ngains in the underlying wealth of the community.</p>\n\n<p>And, as is now well known to all of us, the same net loss to society comes\nfrom reckless overproduction and monopolistic underproduction of natural\nand manufactured commodities.</p>\n\n<p>Overproduction, underproduction and speculation are three evil sisters who\ndistill the troubles of unsound inflation and disastrous deflation. It is\nto the interest of the Nation to have Government help private enterprise to\ngain sound general price levels and to protect those levels from wide\nperilous fluctuations. We know now that if early in 1931 Government had\ntaken the steps which were taken two and three years later, the depression\nwould never have reached the depths of the beginning of 1933.</p>\n\n<p>Sober second thought confirms most of us in the belief that the broad\nobjectives of the National Recovery Act were sound. We know now that its\ndifficulties arose from the fact that it tried to do too much. For example,\nit was unwise to expect the same agency to regulate the length of working\nhours, minimum wages, child labor and collective bargaining on the one hand\nand the complicated questions of unfair trade practices and business\ncontrols on the other.</p>\n\n<p>The statute of N.R.A. has been outlawed. The problems have not. They are\nstill with us.</p>\n\n<p>That decent conditions and adequate pay for labor, and just return for\nagriculture, can be secured through parallel and simultaneous action by\nforty-eight States is a proven impossibility. It is equally impossible to\nobtain curbs on monopoly, unfair trade practices and speculation by State\naction alone. There are those who, sincerely or insincerely, still cling to\nState action as a theoretical hope. But experience with actualities makes\nit clear that Federal laws supplementing State laws are needed to help\nsolve the problems which result from modern invention applied in an\nindustrialized Nation which conducts its business with scant regard to\nState lines.</p>\n\n<p>During the past year there has been a growing belief that there is little\nfault to be found with the Constitution of the United States as it stands\ntoday. The vital need is not an alteration of our fundamental law, but an\nincreasingly enlightened view with reference to it. Difficulties have grown\nout of its interpretation; but rightly considered, it can be used as an\ninstrument of progress, and not as a device for prevention of action.</p>\n\n<p>It is worth our while to read and reread the preamble of the Constitution,\nand Article I thereof which confers the legislative powers upon the\nCongress of the United States. It is also worth our while to read again the\ndebates in the Constitutional Convention of one hundred and fifty years\nago. From such reading, I obtain the very definite thought that the members\nof that Convention were fully aware that civilization would raise problems\nfor the proposed new Federal Government, which they themselves could not\neven surmise; and that it was their definite intent and expectation that a\nliberal interpretation in the years to come would give to the Congress the\nsame relative powers over new national problems as they themselves gave to\nthe Congress over the national problems of their day.</p>\n\n<p>In presenting to the Convention the first basic draft of the Constitution,\nEdmund Randolph explained that it was the purpose "to insert essential\nprinciples only, lest the operation of government should be clogged by\nrendering those provisions permanent and unalterable which ought to be\naccommodated to times and events."</p>\n\n<p>With a better understanding of our purposes, and a more intelligent\nrecognition of our needs as a Nation, it is not to be assumed that there\nwill be prolonged failure to bring legislative and judicial action into\ncloser harmony. Means must be found to adapt our legal forms and our\njudicial interpretation to the actual present national needs of the largest\nprogressive democracy in the modern world.</p>\n\n<p>That thought leads to a consideration of world problems. To go no further\nback than the beginning of this century, men and women everywhere were\nseeking conditions of life very different from those which were customary\nbefore modern invention and modern industry and modern communications had\ncome into being. The World war, for all of its tragedy, encouraged these\ndemands, and stimulated action to fulfill these new desires.</p>\n\n<p>Many national Governments seemed unable adequately to respond; and, often\nwith the improvident assent of the masses of the people themselves, new\nforms of government were set up with oligarchy taking the place of\ndemocracy. In oligarchies, militarism has leapt forward, while in those\nNations which have retained democracy, militarism has waned.</p>\n\n<p>I have recently visited three of our sister Republics in South America. The\nvery cordial receptions with which I was greeted were in tribute to\ndemocracy. To me the outstanding observation of that visit was that the\nmasses of the peoples of all the Americas are convinced that the democratic\nform of government can be made to succeed and do not wish to substitute for\nit any other form of government. They believe that democracies are best\nable to cope with the changing problems of modern civilization within\nthemselves, and that democracies are best able to maintain peace among\nthemselves.</p>\n\n<p>The Inter-American Conference, operating on these fundamental principles of\ndemocracy, did much to assure peace in this Hemisphere. Existing peace\nmachinery was improved. New instruments to maintain peace and eliminate\ncauses of war were adopted. Wider protection of the interests of the\nAmerican Republics in the event of war outside the Western Hemisphere was\nprovided. Respect for, and observance of, international treaties and\ninternational law were strengthened. Principles of liberal trade policies,\nas effective aids to the maintenance of peace, were reaffirmed. The\nintellectual and cultural relationships among American Republics were\nbroadened as a part of the general peace program.</p>\n\n<p>In a world unhappily thinking in terms of war, the representatives of\ntwenty-one Nations sat around a table, in an atmosphere of complete\nconfidence and understanding, sincerely discussing measures for maintaining\npeace. Here was a great and a permanent achievement directly affecting the\nlives and security of the two hundred and fifty million human beings who\ndwell in this Western Hemisphere. Here was an example which must have a\nwholesome effect upon the rest of the world.</p>\n\n<p>In a very real sense, the Conference in Buenos Aires sent forth a message\non behalf of all the democracies of the world to those Nations which live\notherwise. Because such other Governments are perhaps more spectacular, it\nwas high time for democracy to assert itself.</p>\n\n<p>Because all of us believe that our democratic form of government can cope\nadequately with modern problems as they arise, it is patriotic as well as\nlogical for us to prove that we can meet new national needs with new laws\nconsistent with an historic constitutional framework clearly intended to\nreceive liberal and not narrow interpretation.</p>\n\n<p>The United States of America, within itself, must continue the task of\nmaking democracy succeed.</p>\n\n<p>In that task the Legislative branch of our Government will, I am confident,\ncontinue to meet the demands of democracy whether they relate to the\ncurbing of abuses, the extension of help to those who need help, or the\nbetter balancing of our interdependent economies.</p>\n\n<p>So, too, the Executive branch of the Government must move forward in this\ntask, and, at the same time, provide better management for administrative\naction of all kinds.</p>\n\n<p>The Judicial branch also is asked by the people to do its part in making\ndemocracy successful. We do not ask the Courts to call non-existent powers\ninto being, but we have a right to expect that conceded powers or those\nlegitimately implied shall be made effective instruments for the common\ngood.</p>\n\n<p>The process of our democracy must not be imperiled by the denial of\nessential powers of free government.</p>\n\n<p>Your task and mine is not ending with the end of the depression. The people\nof the United States have made it clear that they expect us to continue our\nactive efforts in behalf of their peaceful advancement.</p>\n\n<p>In that spirit of endeavor and service I greet the 75th Congress at the\nbeginning of this auspicious New Year.\n</p>\n\t\t\t<div class="textNav"><a href="#top">^ Return to top</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>\n\t<div id="footer"><strong><em>State of the Union</em></strong> is a project\n\t\tby Brad Borevitz at <a href="http://www.onetwothree.net">onetwothree.net</a></div>\n</div>\n<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">\n</script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n_uacct = "UA-410742-1";\nurchinTracker();\n</script>\n</body>\n<!-- InstanceEnd -->\n</html>\n'
