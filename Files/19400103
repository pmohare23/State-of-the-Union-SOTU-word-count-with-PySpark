Roosevelt</h2>\n\t\t\t<h3>January 3, 1940</h3>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p>\nMr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Senate and the House of\nRepresentatives:</p>\n\n<p>I wish each and every one of you a very happy New Year.</p>\n\n<p>As the Congress reassembles, the impact of war abroad makes it natural to\napproach "the state of the union" through a discussion of foreign affairs.</p>\n\n<p>But it is important that those who hear and read this message should in no\nway confuse that approach with any thought that our Government is\nabandoning, or even overlooking, the great significance of its domestic\npolicies.</p>\n\n<p>The social and economic forces which have been mismanaged abroad until they\nhave resulted in revolution, dictatorship and war are the same as those\nwhich we here are struggling to adjust peacefully at home.</p>\n\n<p>You are well aware that dictatorships--and the philosophy of force that\njustifies and accompanies dictatorships--have originated in almost every\ncase in the necessity for drastic action to improve internal conditions in\nplaces where democratic action for one reason or another has failed to\nrespond to modern needs and modern demands.</p>\n\n<p>It was with far-sighted wisdom that the framers of our Constitution brought\ntogether in one magnificent phrase three great concepts--"common defense,"\n"general welfare" and "domestic tranquility."</p>\n\n<p>More than a century and a half later we, who are here today, still believe\nwith them that our best defense is the promotion of our general welfare and\ndomestic tranquillity.</p>\n\n<p>In previous messages to the Congress I have repeatedly warned that, whether\nwe like it or not, the daily lives of American citizens will, of necessity,\nfeel the shock of events on other continents. This is no longer mere\ntheory; because it has been definitely proved to us by the facts of\nyesterday and today.</p>\n\n<p>To say that the domestic well-being of one hundred and thirty million\nAmericans is deeply affected by the well-being or the ill-being of the\npopulations of other nations is only to recognize in world affairs the\ntruth that we all accept in home affairs.</p>\n\n<p>If in any local unit--a city, county, State or region--low standards of\nliving are permitted to continue, the level of the civilization of the\nentire nation will be pulled downward.</p>\n\n<p>The identical principle extends to the rest of the civilized world. But\nthere are those who wishfully insist, in innocence or ignorance or both,\nthat the United States of America as a self-contained unit can live happily\nand prosperously, its future secure, inside a high wall of isolation while,\noutside, the rest of Civilization and the commerce and culture of mankind\nare shattered.</p>\n\n<p>I can understand the feelings of those who warn the nation that they will\nnever again consent to the sending of American youth to fight on the soil\nof Europe. But, as I remember, nobody has asked them to consent--for nobody\nexpects such an undertaking.</p>\n\n<p>The overwhelming majority of our fellow citizens do not abandon in the\nslightest their hope and their expectation that the United States will not\nbecome involved in military participation in these wars.</p>\n\n<p>I can also understand the wishfulness of those who oversimplify the whole\nsituation by repeating that all we have to do is to mind our own business\nand keep the nation out of war. But there is a vast difference between\nkeeping out of war and pretending that this war is none of our business.</p>\n\n<p>We do not have to go to war with other nations, but at least we can strive\nwith other nations to encourage the kind of peace that will lighten the\ntroubles of the world, and by so doing help our own nation as well.</p>\n\n<p>I ask that all of us everywhere think things through with the single aim of\nhow best to serve the future of our own nation. I do not mean merely its\nfuture relationship with the outside world. I mean its domestic future as\nwell--the work, the security, the prosperity, the happiness, the life of all\nthe boys and girls in the United States, as they are inevitably affected by\nsuch world relationships. For it becomes clearer and clearer that the\nfuture world will be a shabby and dangerous place to live in--yes, even for\nAmericans to live in--if it is ruled by force in the hands of a few.</p>\n\n<p>Already the crash of swiftly moving events over the earth has made us all\nthink with a longer view. Fortunately, that thinking cannot be controlled\nby partisanship. The time is long past when any political party or any\nparticular group can curry or capture public favor by labeling itself the\n"peace party" or the "peace bloc." That label belongs to the whole United\nStates and to every right thinking man, woman and child within it.</p>\n\n<p>For out of all the military and diplomatic turmoil, out of all the\npropaganda, and counter-propaganda of the present conflicts, there are two\nfacts which stand out, and which the whole world acknowledges.</p>\n\n<p>The first is that never before has the Government of the United States of\nAmerica done so much as in our recent past to establish and maintain the\npolicy of the Good Neighbor with its sister nations.</p>\n\n<p>The second is that in almost every nation in the world today there is a\ntrue public belief that the United States has been, and will continue to\nbe, a potent and active factor in seeking the reestablishment of world\npeace.</p>\n\n<p>In these recent years we have had a clean record of peace and good-will. It\nis an open book that cannot be twisted or defamed. It is a record that must\nbe continued and enlarged.</p>\n\n<p>So I hope that Americans everywhere will work out for themselves the\nseveral alternatives which lie before world civilization, which necessarily\nincludes our own.</p>\n\n<p>We must look ahead and see the possibilities for our children if the rest\nof the world comes to be dominated by concentrated force alone--even though\ntoday we are a very great and a very powerful nation.</p>\n\n<p>We must look ahead and see the effect on our own future if all the small\nnations of the world have their independence snatched from them or become\nmere appendages to relatively vast and powerful military systems.</p>\n\n<p>We must look ahead and see the kind of lives our children would have to\nlead if a large part of the rest of the world were compelled to worship a\ngod imposed by a military ruler, or were forbidden to worship God at all;\nif the rest of the world were forbidden to read and hear the facts--the\ndaily news of their own and other nations--if they were deprived of the\ntruth that makes men free.</p>\n\n<p>We must look ahead and see the effect on our future generations if world\ntrade is controlled by any nation or group of nations which sets up that\ncontrol through military force.</p>\n\n<p>It is, of course, true that the record of past centuries includes\ndestruction of many small nations, the enslavement of peoples, and the\nbuilding of empires on the foundation of force. But wholly apart from the\ngreater international morality which we seek today, we recognize the\npractical fact that with modern weapons and modern conditions, modern man\ncan no longer lead a civilized life if we are to go back to the practice of\nwars and conquests of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.</p>\n\n<p>Summing up this need of looking ahead, and in words of common sense and\ngood American citizenship. I hope that we shall have fewer American\nostriches in our midst. It is not good for the ultimate health of ostriches\nto bury their heads in the sand.</p>\n\n<p>Only an ostrich would look upon these wars through the eyes of cynicism or\nridicule.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, the peoples of other nations have the right to choose their own\nform of Government. But we in this nation still believe that such choice\nshould be predicated on certain freedoms which we think are essential\neverywhere. We know that we ourselves shall never be wholly safe at home\nunless other governments recognize such freedoms.</p>\n\n<p>Twenty-one American Republics, expressing the will of two hundred and fifty\nmillion people to preserve peace and freedom in this Hemisphere, are\ndisplaying a unanimity of ideals and practical relationships which gives\nhope that what is being done here can be done on other continents. We in\nall the Americas are coming to the realization that we can retain our\nrespective nationalities without, at the same time, threatening the\nnational existence of our neighbors.</p>\n\n<p>Such truly friendly relationships, for example, permit us to follow our own\ndomestic policies with reference to our agricultural products, while at the\nsame time we have the privilege of trying to work out mutual assistance\narrangements for a world distribution of world agricultural surpluses.</p>\n\n<p>And we have been able to apply the same simple principle to many\nmanufactured products--surpluses of which must be sold in the world export\nmarkets if we intend to continue a high level of production and\nemployment.</p>\n\n<p>For many years after the World War blind economic selfishness in most\ncountries, including our own, resulted in a destructive mine-field of trade\nrestrictions which blocked the channels of commerce among nations. Indeed,\nthis policy was one of the contributing causes of existing wars. It dammed\nup vast unsalable surpluses, helping to bring about unemployment and\nsuffering in the United States and everywhere else.</p>\n\n<p>To point the way to break up that log-jam our Trade Agreements Act was\npassed--based upon a policy of equality of treatment among nations and of\nmutually profitable arrangements of trade.</p>\n\n<p>It is not correct to infer that legislative powers have been transferred\nfrom the Congress to the Executive Branch of the Government. Everyone\nrecognizes that general tariff legislation is a Congressional function; but\nwe know that, because of the stupendous task involved in the fashioning and\nthe passing of a general tariff law, it is advisable to provide at times of\nemergency some flexibility to make the general law adjustable to quickly\nchanging conditions.</p>\n\n<p>We are in such a time today. Our present trade agreement method provides a\ntemporary flexibility and is, therefore, practical in the best sense. It\nshould be kept alive to serve our trade interests--agricultural and\nindustrial--in many valuable ways during the existing wars.</p>\n\n<p>But what is more important, the Trade Agreements Act should be extended as\nan indispensable part of the foundation of any stable and enduring peace.</p>\n\n<p>The old conditions of world trade made for no enduring peace; and when the\ntime comes, the United States must use its influence to open up the trade\nchannels of the world, in all nations, in order that no one nation need\nfeel compelled in later days to seek by force of arms what it can well gain\nby peaceful conference. For that purpose, too, we need the Trade Agreements\nAct even more today than when it was passed.</p>\n\n<p>I emphasize the leadership which this nation can take when the time comes\nfor a renewal of world peace. Such an influence will be greatly weakened if\nthis Government becomes a dog in the manger of trade selfishness.</p>\n\n<p>The first President of the United States warned us against entangling\nforeign alliances. The present President of the United States subscribes to\nand follows that precept.</p>\n\n<p>I hope that most of you will agree that trade cooperation with the rest of\nthe world does not violate that precept in any way.</p>\n\n<p>Even as through these trade agreements we prepare to cooperate in a world\nthat wants peace, we must likewise be prepared to take care of ourselves if\nthe world cannot attain peace.</p>\n\n<p>For several years past we have been compelled to strengthen our own\nnational defense. That has created a very large portion of our Treasury\ndeficits. This year in the light of continuing world uncertainty, I am\nasking the Congress for Army and Navy increases which are based not on\npanic but on common sense. They are not as great as enthusiastic alarmists\nseek. They are not as small as unrealistic persons claiming superior\nprivate information would demand.</p>\n\n<p>As will appear in the annual budget tomorrow, the only important increase\nin any part of the budget is the estimate for national defense. Practically\nall other important items show a reduction. But you know, you can\'t eat\nyour cake and have it too. Therefore, in the hope that we can continue in\nthese days of increasing economic prosperity to reduce the Federal deficit,\nI am asking the Congress to levy sufficient additional taxes to meet the\nemergency spending for national defense.</p>\n\n<p>Behind the Army and Navy, of course, lies our ultimate line of defense--"the\ngeneral welfare" of our people. We cannot report, despite all the progress\nthat we have made in our domestic problems--despite the fact that production\nis back to 1929 levels--that all our problems are solved. The fact of\nunemployment of millions of men and women remains a symptom of a number of\ndifficulties in our economic system not yet adjusted.</p>\n\n<p>While the number of the unemployed has decreased very greatly, while their\nimmediate needs for food and clothing--as far as the Federal Government is\nconcerned--have been largely met, while their morale has been kept alive by\ngiving them useful public work, we have not yet found a way to employ the\nsurplus of our labor which the efficiency of our industrial processes has\ncreated.</p>\n\n<p>We refuse the European solution of using the unemployed to build up\nexcessive armaments which eventually result in dictatorships and war. We\nencourage an American way--through an increase of national income which is\nthe only way we can be sure will take up the slack. Much progress has been\nmade; much remains to be done.</p>\n\n<p>We recognize that we must find an answer in terms of work and opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>The unemployment problem today has become very definitely a problem of\nyouth as well as of age. As each year has gone by hundreds of thousands of\nboys and girls have come of working age. They now form an army of unused\nyouth. They must be an especial concern of democratic Government.</p>\n\n<p>We must continue, above all things, to look for a solution of their special\nproblem. For they, looking ahead to life, are entitled to action on our\npart and not merely to admonitions of optimism or lectures on economic\nlaws.</p>\n\n<p>Some in our midst have sought to instill a feeling of fear and defeatism in\nthe minds of the American people about this problem.</p>\n\n<p>To face the task of finding jobs faster than invention can take them\naway--is not defeatism. To warble easy platitudes that if we would only go\nback to ways that have failed, everything would be all right--is not\ncourage.</p>\n\n<p>In 1933 we met a problem of real fear and real defeatism. We faced the\nfacts--with action and not with words alone.</p>\n\n<p>The American people will reject the doctrine of fear, confident that in the\n\'thirties we have been building soundly a new order of things, different\nfrom the order of the \'twenties. In this dawn of the decade of the\n\'forties, with our program of social improvement started, we will continue\nto carry on the processes of recovery, so as to preserve our gains and\nprovide jobs at living wages.</p>\n\n<p>There are, of course, many other items of great public interest which could\nbe enumerated in this message--the continued conservation of our natural\nresources, the improvement of health and of education, the extension of\nsocial security to larger groups, the freeing of large areas from\nrestricted transportation discriminations, the extension of the merit\nsystem and many others.</p>\n\n<p>Our continued progress in the social and economic field is important not\nonly for the significance of each part of it but for the total effect which\nour program of domestic betterment has upon that most valuable asset of a\nnation in dangerous times--its national unity.</p>\n\n<p>The permanent security of America in the present crisis does not lie in\narmed force alone. What we face is a set of world-wide forces of\ndisintegration--vicious, ruthless, destructive of all the moral, religious\nand political standards which mankind, after centuries of struggle, has\ncome to cherish most.</p>\n\n<p>In these moral values, in these forces which have made our nation great, we\nmust actively and practically reassert our faith.</p>\n\n<p>These words--"national unity"--must not be allowed to be come merely a\nhigh-sounding phrase, a vague generality, a pious hope, to which everyone\ncan give lip-service. They must be made to have real meaning in terms of\nthe daily thoughts and acts of every man, woman and child in our land\nduring the coming year and during the years that lie ahead.</p>\n\n<p>For national unity is, in a very real and a very deep sense, the\nfundamental safeguard of all democracy.</p>\n\n<p>Doctrines that set group against group, faith against faith, race against\nrace, class against class, fanning the fires of hatred in men too\ndespondent, too desperate to think for themselves, were used as\nrabble-rousing slogans on which dictators could ride to power. And once in\npower they could saddle their tyrannies on whole nations and on their\nweaker neighbors.</p>\n\n<p>This is the danger to which we in America must begin to be more alert. For\nthe apologists for foreign aggressors, and equally those selfish and\npartisan groups at home who wrap themselves in a false mantle of\nAmericanism to promote their own economic, financial or political\nadvantage, are now trying European tricks upon us, seeking to muddy the\nstream of our national thinking, weakening us in the face of danger, by\ntrying to set our own people to fighting among themselves. Such tactics are\nwhat have helped to plunge Europe into war. We must combat them, as we\nwould the plague, if American integrity and American security are to be\npreserved. We cannot afford to face the future as a disunited people.</p>\n\n<p>We must as a united people keep ablaze on this continent the flames of\nhuman liberty, of reason, of democracy and of fair play as living things to\nbe preserved for the better world that is to come.</p>\n\n<p>Overstatement, bitterness, vituperation, and the beating of drums have\ncontributed mightily to ill-feeling and wars between nations. If these\nunnecessary and unpleasant actions are harmful in the international field,\nif they have hurt in other parts of the world, they are also harmful in the\ndomestic scene. Peace among ourselves would seem to have some of the\nadvantage of peace between us and other nations. In the long run history\namply demonstrates that angry controversy surely wins less than calm\ndiscussion.</p>\n\n<p>In the spirit, therefore, of a greater unselfishness, recognizing that the\nworld--including the United States of America--passes through perilous\ntimes, I am very hopeful that the closing session of the Seventy-sixth\nCongress will consider the needs of the nation and of humanity with\ncalmness, with tolerance and with cooperative wisdom.</p>\n\n<p>May the year 1940 be pointed to by our children as another period when\ndemocracy justified its existence as the best instrument of government yet\ndevised by mankind.\n</p>\n\t\t\t<div class="textNav"><a href="#top">^ Return to top</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>\n\t<div id="footer"><strong><em>State of the Union</em></strong> is a project\n\t\tby Brad Borevitz at <a href="http://www.onetwothree.net">onetwothree.net</a></div>\n</div>\n<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">\n</script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n_uacct = "UA-410742-1";\nurchinTracker();\n</script>\n</body>\n<!-- InstanceEnd -->\n</html>\n'
