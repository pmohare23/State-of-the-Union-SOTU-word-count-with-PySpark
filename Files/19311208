Our national\nconcern has been to meet the emergencies it has created for us and to lay\nthe foundations for recovery.</p>\n\n<p>If we lift our vision beyond these immediate emergencies we find\nfundamental national gains even amid depression. In meeting the problems of\nthis difficult period, we have witnessed a remarkable development of the\nsense of cooperation in the community. For the first time in the history of\nour major economic depressions there has been a notable absence of public\ndisorders and industrial conflict. Above all there is an enlargement of\nsocial and spiritual responsibility among the people. The strains and\nstresses upon business have resulted in closer application, in saner\npolicies, and in better methods. Public improvements have been carried out\non a larger scale than even in normal times. The country is richer in\nphysical property, in newly discovered resources, and in productive\ncapacity than ever before. There has been constant gain in knowledge and\neducation; there has been continuous advance in science and invention;\nthere has been distinct gain in public health. Business depressions have\nbeen recurrent in the life of our country and are but transitory. The\nNation has emerged from each of them with increased strength and virility\nbecause of the enlightenment they have brought, the readjustments and the\nlarger understanding of the realities and obligations of life and work\nwhich come from them.</p>\n\n<p>NATIONAL DEFENSE</p>\n\n<p>Both our Army and Navy have been maintained in a high state of efficiency.\nThe ability and devotion of both officers and men sustain the highest\ntraditions of the service. Reductions and postponements in expenditure of\nthese departments to meet the present emergency are being made without\nreducing existing personnel or impairing the morale of either\nestablishment.</p>\n\n<p>The agreement between the leading naval powers for limitation of naval\narmaments and establishment of their relative strength and thus elimination\nof competitive building also implies for ourselves the gradual expansion of\nthe deficient categories in our Navy to the parities provided in those\ntreaties. However, none of the other nations, parties to these agreements,\nis to-day maintaining the full rate of construction which the treaty size\nof fleets would imply.</p>\n\n<p>Although these agreements secured the maximum reduction of fleets which it\nwas at that time possible to attain, I am hopeful that the naval powers,\nparty to these agreements, will realize that establishment of relative\nstrength in itself offers opportunity for further reduction without injury\nto any of them. This would be the more possible if pending negotiations are\nsuccessful between France and Italy. If the world is to regain its\nstandards of life, it must further decrease both naval and other arms. The\nsubject will come before the General Disarmament Conference which meets in\nGeneva on February 2.</p>\n\n<p>FOREIGN AFFAIRS</p>\n\n<p>We are at peace with the world. We have cooperated with other nations to\npreserve peace. The rights of our citizens abroad have been protected.</p>\n\n<p>The economic depression has continued and deepened in every part of the\nworld during the past year. In many countries political instability,\nexcessive armaments, debts, governmental expenditures, and taxes have\nresulted in revolutions, in unbalanced budgets and monetary collapse and\nfinancial panics, in dumping of goods upon world markets, and in diminished\nconsumption of commodities.</p>\n\n<p>Within two years there have been revolutions or acute social disorders in\n19 countries, embracing more than half the population of the world. Ten\ncountries have been unable to meet their external obligations. In 14\ncountries, embracing a quarter of the world\'s population, former monetary\nstandards have been temporarily abandoned. In a number of countries there\nhave been acute financial panics or compulsory restraints upon banking.\nThese disturbances have many roots in the dislocations from the World War.\nEvery one of them has reacted upon us. They have sharply affected the\nmarkets and prices of our agricultural and industrial products. They have\nincreased unemployment and greatly embarrassed our financial and credit\nsystem.</p>\n\n<p>As our difficulties during the past year have plainly originated in large\ndegree from these sources, any effort to bring about our own recuperation\nhas dictated the necessity of cooperation by us with other nations in\nreasonable effort to restore world confidence and economic stability.</p>\n\n<p>Cooperation of our Federal reserve system and our banks with the central\nbanks in foreign countries has contributed to localize and ameliorate a\nnumber of serious financial crises or moderate the pressures upon us and\nthus avert disasters which would have affected us.</p>\n\n<p>The economic crisis in Germany and Central Europe last June rose to the\ndimensions of a general panic from which it was apparent that without\nassistance these nations must collapse. Apprehensions of such collapse had\ndemoralized our agricultural and security markets and so threatened other\nnations as to impose further dangers upon us. But of highest importance was\nthe necessity of cooperation on our part to relieve the people of Germany\nfrom imminent disasters and to maintain their important relations to\nprogress and stability in the world. Upon the initiative of this Government\na year\'s postponement of reparations and other intergovernmental debts was\nbrought about. Upon our further initiative an agreement was made by\nGermany\'s private creditors providing for an extension of such credits\nuntil the German people can develop more permanent and definite forms of\nrelief.</p>\n\n<p>We have continued our policy of withdrawing our marines from Haiti and\nNicaragua.</p>\n\n<p>The difficulties between China and Japan have given us great concern, not\nalone for the maintenance of the spirit of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, but for\nthe maintenance of the treaties to which we are a party assuring the\nterritorial integrity of China. It is our purpose to assist in finding\nsolutions sustaining the full spirit of those treaties.</p>\n\n<p>I shall deal at greater length with our foreign relations in a later\nmessage.</p>\n\n<p>THE DOMESTIC SITUATION</p>\n\n<p>Many undertakings have been organized and forwarded during the past year to\nmeet the new and changing emergencies which have constantly confronted us.</p>\n\n<p>Broadly the community has cooperated to meet the needs of honest distress,\nand to take such emergency measures as would sustain confidence in our\nfinancial system and would cushion the violence of liquidation in industry\nand commerce, thus giving time for orderly readjustment of costs,\ninventories, and credits without panic and widespread bankruptcy. These\nmeasures have served those purposes and will promote recovery.</p>\n\n<p>In these measures we have striven to mobilize and stimulate private\ninitiative and local and community responsibility. There has been the least\npossible Government entry into the economic field, and that only in\ntemporary and emergency form. Our citizens and our local governments have\ngiven a magnificent display of unity and action, initiative and patriotism\nin solving a multitude of difficulties and in cooperating with the Federal\nGovernment.</p>\n\n<p>For a proper understanding of my recommendations to the Congress it is\ndesirable very briefly to review such activities during the past year.</p>\n\n<p>The emergencies of unemployment have been met by action in many directions.\nThe appropriations for the continued speeding up of the great Federal\nconstruction program have provided direct and indirect aid to employment\nupon a large scale. By organized unity of action, the States and\nmunicipalities have also maintained large programs of public improvement.\nMany industries have been prevailed upon to anticipate and intensify\nconstruction. Industrial concerns and other employers have been organized\nto spread available work amongst all their employees, instead of\ndischarging a portion of them. A large majority have maintained wages at as\nhigh levels as the safe conduct of their business would permit. This course\nhas saved us from industrial conflict and disorder which have characterized\nall previous depressions. Immigration has been curtailed by administrative\naction. Upon the basis of normal immigration the decrease amounts to about\n300,000 individuals who otherwise would have been added to our\nunemployment. The expansion of Federal employment agencies under\nappropriations by the Congress has proved most effective. Through the\nPresident\'s organization for unemployment relief, public and private\nagencies were successfully mobilized last winter to provide employment and\nother measures against distress. Similar organization gives assurance\nagainst suffering during the coming winter. Committees of leading citizens\nare now active at practically every point of unemployment. In the large\nmajority they have been assured the funds necessary which, together with\nlocal government aids, will meet the situation. A few exceptional\nlocalities will be further organized. The evidence of the Public Health\nService shows an actual decrease of sickness and infant and general\nmortality below normal years. No greater proof could be adduced that our\npeople have been protected from hunger and cold and that the sense of\nsocial responsibility in the Nation has responded to the need of the\nunfortunate.</p>\n\n<p>To meet the emergencies in agriculture the loans authorized by Congress for\nrehabilitation in the drought areas have enabled farmers to produce\nabundant crops in those districts. The Red Cross undertook and\nmagnificently administered relief for over 2,500,000 drought sufferers last\nwinter. It has undertaken this year to administer relief to 100,000\nsufferers in the new drought area of certain Northwest States. The action\nof the Federal Farm Board in granting credits to farm cooperatives saved\nmany of them from bankruptcy and increased their purpose and strength. By\nenabling farm cooperatives to cushion the fall in prices of farm products\nin 1930 and 1931 the Board secured higher prices to the farmer than would\nhave been obtained otherwise, although the benefits of this action were\npartially defeated by continued world overproduction. Incident to this\naction the failure of a large number of farmers and of country banks was\naverted which could quite possibly have spread into a major disaster. The\nbanks in the South have cooperated with the Farm Board in creation of a\npool for the better marketing of accumulated cotton. Growers have been\nmaterially assisted by this action. Constant effort has been made to reduce\noverproduction in relief of agriculture and to promote the foreign buying\nof agricultural products by sustaining economic stability abroad.</p>\n\n<p>To meet our domestic emergencies in credit and banking arising from the\nreaction to acute crisis abroad the National Credit Association was set up\nby the banks with resources of $500,000,000 to support sound banks against\nthe frightened withdrawals and hoarding. It is giving aid to reopen solvent\nbanks which have been closed. Federal officials have brought about many\nbeneficial unions of banks and have employed other means which have\nprevented many bank closings. As a result of these measures the hoarding\nwithdrawals which had risen to over $250,000,000 per week after the British\ncrisis have substantially ceased.</p>\n\n<p>FURTHER MEASURES</p>\n\n<p>The major economic forces and weaknesses at home and abroad have now been\nexposed and can be appraised, and the time is ripe for forward action to\nexpedite our recovery.</p>\n\n<p>Although some of the causes of our depression are due to speculation,\ninflation of securities and real estate, unsound foreign investments, and\nmismanagement of financial institutions, yet our self-contained national\neconomy, with its matchless strength and resources, would have enabled us\nto recover long since but for the continued dislocations, shocks, and\nsetbacks from abroad.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever the causes may be, the vast liquidation and readjustments which\nhave taken place have left us with a large degree of credit paralysis,\nwhich together with the situation in our railways and the conditions\nabroad, are now the outstanding obstacles to recuperation. If we can put\nour financial resources to work and can ameliorate the financial situation\nin the railways, I am confident we can make a large measure of recovery\nindependent of the rest of the world. A strong America is the highest\ncontribution to world stability.</p>\n\n<p>One phase of the credit situation is indicated in the banks. During the\npast year banks, representing 3 per cent of our total deposits have been\nclosed. A large part of these failures have been caused by withdrawals for\nhoarding, as distinguished from the failures early in the depression where\nweakness due to mismanagement was the larger cause of failure. Despite\ntheir closing, many of them will pay in full. Although such withdrawals\nhave practically ceased, yet $1,100,000,000 of currency was previously\nwithdrawn which has still to return to circulation. This represents a large\nreduction of the ability of our banks to extend credit which would\notherwise fertilize industry and agriculture. Furthermore, many of our\nbankers, in order to prepare themselves to meet possible withdrawals, have\nfelt compelled to call in loans, to refuse new credits, and to realize upon\nsecurities, which in turn has demoralized the markets. The paralysis has\nbeen further augmented by the steady increase in recent years of the\nproportion of bank assets invested in long-term securities, such as\nmortgages and bonds. These securities tend to lose their liquidity in\ndepression or temporarily to fall in value so that the ability of the banks\nto meet the shock of sudden withdrawal is greatly lessened and the\nrestriction of all kinds of credit is thereby increased. The continuing\ncredit paralysis has operated to accentuate the deflation and liquidation\nof commodities, real estate, and securities below any reasonable basis of\nvalues.</p>\n\n<p>All of this tends to stifle business, especially the smaller units, and\nfinally expresses itself in further depression of prices and values, in\nrestriction on new enterprise, and in increased unemployment.</p>\n\n<p>The situation largely arises from an unjustified lack of confidence. We\nhave enormous volumes of idle money in the banks and in hoarding. We do not\nrequire more money or working capital--we need to put what we have to\nwork.</p>\n\n<p>The fundamental difficulties which have brought about financial strains in\nforeign countries do not exist in the United States. No external drain on\nour resources can threaten our position, because the balance of\ninternational payments is in our favor; we owe less to foreign countries\nthan they owe to us; our industries are efficiently organized; our currency\nand bank deposits are protected by the greatest gold reserve in history.</p>\n\n<p>Our first step toward recovery is to reestablish confidence and thus\nrestore the flow of credit which is the very basis of our economic life. We\nmust put some steel beams in the foundations of our credit structure. It is\nour duty to apply the full strength of our Government not only to the\nimmediate phases, but to provide security against shocks and the repetition\nof the weaknesses which have been proven.</p>\n\n<p>The recommendations which I here lay before the Congress are designed to\nmeet these needs by strengthening financial, industrial, and agricultural\nlife through the medium of our existing institutions, and thus to avoid the\nentry of the Government into competition with private business.</p>\n\n<p>FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE</p>\n\n<p>The first requirement of confidence and of economic recovery is financial\nstability of the United States Government. I shall deal with fiscal\nquestions at greater length in the Budget message. But I must at this time\ncall attention to the magnitude of the deficits which have developed and\nthe resulting necessity for determined and courageous policies. These\ndeficits arise in the main from the heavy decrease in tax receipts due to\nthe depression and to the increase in expenditure on construction in aid to\nunemployment, aids to agriculture, and upon services to veterans.</p>\n\n<p>During the fiscal year ending June 30 last we incurred a deficit of about\n$903,000,000, which included the statutory reduction of the debt and\nrepresented an increase of the national debt by $616,000,000. Of this,\nhowever, $153,000,000 is offset by increased cash balances.</p>\n\n<p>In comparison with the fiscal year 1928 there is indicated a fall in\nFederal receipts for the present fiscal year amounting to $1,683,000,000,\nof which $1,034,000,000 is in individual and corporate income taxes alone.\nDuring this fiscal year there will be an increased expenditure, as compared\nto 1928, on veterans of $255,000,000, and an increased expenditure on\nconstruction work which may reach $520,000,000. Despite large economies in\nother directions, we have an indicated deficit, including the statutory\nretirement of the debt, of $2,123,000,000, and an indicated net debt\nincrease of about $1,711,000,000.</p>\n\n<p>The Budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1 next, after allowing for\nsome increase of taxes under the present laws and after allowing for\ndrastic reduction in expenditures, still indicates a deficit of\n$1,417,000,000. After offsetting the statutory debt retirements this would\nindicate an increase in the national debt for the fiscal year 1933 of about\n$921,000,000.</p>\n\n<p>Several conclusions are inevitable. We must have insistent and determined\nreduction in Government expenses. We must face a temporary increase in\ntaxes. Such increase should not cover the whole of these deficits or it\nwill retard recovery. We must partially finance the deficit by borrowing.\nIt is my view that the amount of taxation should be fixed so as to balance\nthe Budget for 1933 except for the statutory debt retirement. Such\nGovernment receipts would assure the balance of the following year\'s budget\nincluding debt retirement. It is my further view that the additional\ntaxation should be imposed solely as an emergency measure terminating\ndefinitely two years from July 1 next. Such a basis will give confidence in\nthe determination of the Government to stabilize its finance and will\nassure taxpayers of its temporary character. Even with increased taxation,\nthe Government will reach the utmost safe limit of its borrowing capacity\nby the expenditures for which we are already obligated and the\nrecommendations here proposed. To go further than these limits in either\nexpenditures, taxes, or borrowing will destroy confidence, denude commerce\nand industry of its resources, jeopardize the financial system, and\nactually extend unemployment and demoralize agriculture rather than relieve\nit.</p>\n\n<p>FEDERAL LAND BANKS</p>\n\n<p>I recommend that the Congress authorize the subscription by the Treasury of\nfurther capital to the Federal land banks to be retired as provided in the\noriginal act, or when funds are available, and that repayments of such\ncapital be treated as a fund available for further subscriptions in the\nsame manner. It is urgent that the banks be supported so as to stabilize\nthe market values of their bonds and thus secure capital for the farmers at\nlow rates, that they may continue their services to agriculture and that\nthey may meet the present situation with consideration to the farmers.</p>\n\n<p>DEPOSITS IN CLOSED BANKS</p>\n\n<p>A method should be devised to make available quickly to depositors some\nportion of their deposits in closed banks as the assets of such banks may\nwarrant. Such provision would go far to relieve distress in a multitude of\nfamilies, would stabilize values in many communities, and would liberate\nworking capital to thousands of concerns. I recommend that measures be\nenacted promptly to accomplish these results and I suggest that the\nCongress should consider the development of such a plan through the Federal\nReserve Banks.</p>\n\n<p>HOME-LOAN DISCOUNT BANKS</p>\n\n<p>I recommend the establishment of a system of home-loan discount banks as\nthe necessary companion in our financial structure of the Federal Reserve\nBanks and our Federal Land Banks. Such action will relieve present\ndistressing pressures against home and farm property owners. It will\nrelieve pressures upon and give added strength to building and loan\nassociations, savings banks, and deposit banks, engaged in extending such\ncredits. Such action would further decentralize our credit structure. It\nwould revive residential construction and employment. It would enable such\nloaning institutions more effectually to promote home ownership. I\ndiscussed this plan at some length in a statement made public November 14,\nlast. This plan has been warmly indorsed by the recent National Conference\nupon Home Ownership and Housing, whose members were designated by the\ngovernors of the States and the groups interested.</p>\n\n<p>RECONSTRUCTION FINANCE CORPORATION</p>\n\n<p>In order that the public may be absolutely assured and that the Government\nmay be in position to meet any public necessity, I recommend that an\nemergency Reconstruction Corporation of the nature of the former War\nFinance Corporation should be established. It may not be necessary to use\nsuch an instrumentality very extensively. The very existence of such a\nbulwark will strengthen confidence. The Treasury should be authorized to\nsubscribe a reasonable capital to it, and it should be given authority to\nissue its own debentures. It should be placed in liquidation at the end of\ntwo years. Its purpose is that by strengthening the weak spots to thus\nliberate the full strength of the Nation\'s resources. It should be in\nposition to facilitate exports by American agencies; make advances to\nagricultural credit agencies where necessary to protect and aid the\nagricultural industry; to make temporary advances upon proper securities to\nestablished industries, railways, and financial institutions which can not\notherwise secure credit, and where such advances will protect the credit\nstructure and stimulate employment. Its functions would not overlap those\nof the National Credit Corporation.</p>\n\n<p>FEDERAL RESERVE ELIGIBILITY</p>\n\n<p>On October 6th I issued a statement that I should recommend to the Congress\nan extension during emergencies of the eligibility provisions in the\nFederal reserve act. This statement was approved by a representative\ngathering of the Members of both Houses of the Congress, including members\nof the appropriate committees. It was approved by the officials of the\nTreasury Department, and I understand such an extension has been approved\nby a majority of the governors of the Federal reserve banks. Nothing should\nbe done which would lower the safeguards of the system.</p>\n\n<p>The establishment of the mortgage-discount banks herein referred to will\nalso contribute to further reserve strength in the banks without\ninflation.</p>\n\n<p>BANKING LAWS</p>\n\n<p>Our people have a right to a banking system in which their deposits shall\nbe safeguarded and the flow of credit less subject to storms. The need of a\nsounder system is plainly shown by the extent of bank failures. I recommend\nthe prompt improvement of the banking laws. Changed financial conditions\nand commercial practices must be met. The Congress should investigate the\nneed for separation between different kinds of banking; an enlargement of\nbranch banking under proper restrictions; and the methods by which enlarged\nmembership in the Federal reserve system may be brought about.</p>\n\n<p>POSTAL SAVINGS BANKS</p>\n\n<p>The Postal Savings deposits have increased from about $200,000,000 to about\n$550,000,000 during the past year. This experience has raised important\npractical questions in relation to deposits and investments which should\nreceive the attention of the Congress.</p>\n\n<p>RAILWAYS</p>\n\n<p>The railways present one of our immediate and pressing problems. They are\nand must remain the backbone of our transportation system. Their prosperity\nis interrelated with the prosperity of all industries. Their fundamental\nservice in transportation, the volume of their employment, their buying\npower for supplies from other industries, the enormous investment in their\nsecurities, particularly their bonds, by insurance companies, savings\nbanks, benevolent and other trusts, all reflect their partnership in the\nwhole economic fabric. Through these institutions the railway bonds are in\na large sense the investment of every family. The well-maintained and\nsuccessful operation and the stability of railway finances are of primary\nimportance to economic recovery. They should have more effective\nopportunity to reduce operating costs by proper consolidation. As their\nrates must be regulated in public interest, so also approximate regulation\nshould be applied to competing services by some authority. The methods of\ntheir regulation should be revised. The Interstate Commerce Commission has\nmade important and far-reaching recommendations upon the whole subject,\nwhich I commend to the early consideration of the Congress.</p>\n\n<p>ANTITRUST LAWS</p>\n\n<p>In my message of a year ago I commented on the necessity of congressional\ninquiry into the economic action of the antitrust laws. There is wide\nconviction that some change should be made especially in the procedure\nunder these laws. I do not favor their repeal. Such action would open wide\nthe door to price fixing, monopoly, and destruction of healthy competition.\nParticular attention should be given to the industries rounded upon natural\nresources, especially where destructive competition produces great wastes\nof these resources and brings great hardships upon operators, employees,\nand the public. In recent years there has been continued demoralization in\nthe bituminous coal, oil, and lumber industries. I again commend the matter\nto the consideration of the Congress.</p>\n\n<p>UNEMPLOYMENT</p>\n\n<p>As an aid to unemployment the Federal Government is engaged in the greatest\nprogram of public-building, harbor, flood-control, highway, waterway,\naviation, merchant and naval ship construction in all history. Our\nexpenditures on these works during this calendar year will reach about\n$780,000,000 compared with $260,000,000 in 1928. Through this increased\nconstruction, through the maintenance of a full complement of Federal\nemployees, and through services to veterans it is estimated that the\nFederal taxpayer is now directly contributing to the livelihood of\n10,000,000 of our citizens.</p>\n\n<p>We must avoid burdens upon the Government which will create more\nunemployment in private industry than can be gained by further expansion of\nemployment by the Federal Government. We can now stimulate employment and\nagriculture more effectually and speedily through the voluntary measures in\nprogress, through the thawing out of credit, through the building up of\nstability abroad, through the home loan discount banks, through an\nemergency finance corporation and the rehabilitation of the railways and\nother such directions.</p>\n\n<p>I am opposed to any direct or indirect Government dole. The breakdown and\nincreased unemployment in Europe is due in part to such practices. Our\npeople are providing against distress from unemployment in true American\nfashion by a magnificent response to public appeal and by action of the\nlocal governments.</p>\n\n<p>GENERAL LEGISLATION</p>\n\n<p>There are many other subjects requiring legislative action at this session\nof the Congress. I may list the following among them:</p>\n\n<p>VETERANS\' SERVICES</p>\n\n<p>The law enacted last March authorizing loans of 50 per cent upon\nadjusted-service certificates has, together with the loans made under\nprevious laws, resulted in payments of about $1,260,000,000. Appropriations\nhave been exhausted. The Administrator of Veterans\' Affairs advises that a\nfurther appropriation of $200,000,000 is required at once to meet the\nobligations made necessary by existing legislation.</p>\n\n<p>There will be demands for further veterans\' legislation; there are\ninequalities in our system of veterans\' relief; it is our national duty to\nmeet our obligations to those who have served the Nation. But our present\nexpenditure upon these services now exceeds $1,000,000,000 per annum. I am\nopposed to any extension of these expenditures until the country has\nrecovered from the present situation.</p>\n\n<p>ELECTRICAL-POWER REGULATION</p>\n\n<p>I have recommended in previous messages the effective regulation of\ninterstate electrical power as the essential function of the reorganized\nFederal Power Commission. I renew the recommendation. It is urgently needed\nin public protection.</p>\n\n<p>MUSCLE SHOALS</p>\n\n<p>At my suggestion, the Governors and Legislatures of Alabama and Tennessee\nselected three members each for service on a committee to which I appointed\na representative of the farm organizations and two representatives of the\nWar Department for the purpose of recommending a plan for the disposal of\nthese properties which would be in the interest of the people of those\nStates and the agricultural industry throughout the country. I shall\ntransmit the recommendations to the Congress.</p>\n\n<p>REORGANIZATION OF FEDERAL DEPARTMENTS</p>\n\n<p>I have referred in previous messages to the profound need of further\nreorganization and consolidation of Federal administrative functions to\neliminate overlap and waste, and to enable coordination and definition of\nGovernment policies now wholly impossible in scattered and conflicting\nagencies which deal with parts of the same major function. I shall lay\nbefore the Congress further recommendations upon this subject, particularly\nin relation to the Department of the Interior. There are two directions of\nsuch reorganization, however, which have an important bearing upon the\nemergency problems with which we are confronted.</p>\n\n<p>SHIPPING BOARD</p>\n\n<p>At present the Shipping Board exercises large administrative functions\nindependent of the Executive. These administrative functions should be\ntransferred to the Department of Commerce, in keeping with that single\nresponsibility which has been the basis of our governmental structure since\nits foundation. There should be created in that department a position of\nAssistant Secretary for Merchant Marine, under whom this work and the\nseveral bureaus having to do with merchant marine may be grouped.</p>\n\n<p>The Shipping Board should be made a regulatory body acting also in advisory\ncapacity on loans and policies, in keeping with its original conception.\nIts regulatory powers should be amended to include regulation of coastwise\nshipping so as to assure stability and better service. It is also worthy of\nconsideration that the regulation of rates and services upon the inland\nwaterways should be assigned to such a reorganized board.</p>\n\n<p>REORGANIZATION OF PUBLIC WORKS ADMINISTRATION</p>\n\n<p>I recommend that all building and construction activities of the Government\nnow carried on by many departments be consolidated into an independent\nestablishment under the President to be known as the "Public Works\nAdministration" directed by a Public Works Administrator. This agency\nshould undertake all construction work in service to the different\ndepartments of the Government (except naval and military work). The\nservices of the Corps of Army Engineers should be delegated in rotation for\nmilitary duty to this administration in continuation of their supervision\nof river and harbor work. Great economies, sounder policies, more effective\ncoordination to employment, and expedition in all construction work would\nresult from this consolidation.</p>\n\n<p>LAW ENFORCEMENT</p>\n\n<p>I shall present some recommendations in a special message looking to the\nstrengthening of criminal-law enforcement and improvement in judicial\nprocedure connected therewith.</p>\n\n<p>INLAND WATERWAY AND HARBOR IMPROVEMENT</p>\n\n<p>These improvements are now proceeding upon an unprecedented scale. Some\nindication of the volume of work in progress is conveyed by the fact that\nduring the current year over 380,000,000 cubic yards of material have been\nmoved--an amount equal to the entire removal in the construction of the\nPanama Canal. The Mississippi waterway system, connecting Chicago, Kansas\nCity, Pittsburgh, and New Orleans, will be in full operation during 1933.\nSubstantial progress is being made upon the projects of the upper Missouri,\nupper Mississippi, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Negotiations are now in progress with Canada for the construction of the\nSt. Lawrence Waterway.</p>\n\n<p>THE TARIFF</p>\n\n<p>Wages and standards of living abroad have been materially lowered during\nthe past year. The temporary abandonment of the gold standard by certain\ncountries has also reduced their production costs compared to ours.\nFortunately any increases in the tariff which may be necessary to protect\nagriculture and industry from these lowered foreign costs, or decreases in\nitems which may prove to be excessive, may be undertaken at any time by the\nTariff Commission under authority which it possesses by virtue of the\ntariff act of 1930. The commission during the past year has reviewed the\nrates upon over 254 items subject to tariff. As a result of vigorous and\nindustrious action, it is up to date in the consideration of pending\nreferences and is prepared to give prompt attention to any further\napplications. This procedure presents an orderly method for correcting\ninequalities. I am opposed to any general congressional revision of the\ntariff. Such action would disturb industry, business, and agriculture. It\nwould prolong the depression.</p>\n\n<p>IMMIGRATION AND DEPORTATION</p>\n\n<p>I recommend that immigration restriction now in force under administrative\naction be placed upon a more definite basis by law. The deportation laws\nshould be strengthened. Aliens lawfully in the country should be protected\nby the issuance of a certificate of residence.</p>\n\n<p>PUBLIC HEALTH</p>\n\n<p>I again call attention to my previous recommendations upon this subject,\nparticularly in its relation to children. The moral results are of the\nutmost importance.</p>\n\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n\n<p>It is inevitable that in these times much of the legislation proposed to\nthe Congress and many of the recommendations of the Executive must be\ndesigned to meet emergencies. In reaching solutions we must not jeopardize\nthose principles which we have found to be the basis of the growth of the\nNation. The Federal Government must not encroach upon nor permit local\ncommunities to abandon that precious possession of local initiative and\nresponsibility. Again, just as the largest measure of responsibility in the\ngovernment of the Nation rests upon local self-government, so does the\nlargest measure of social responsibility in our country rest upon the\nindividual. If the individual surrenders his own initiative and\nresponsibilities, he is surrendering his own freedom and his own liberty.\nIt is the duty of the National Government to insist that both the local\ngovernments and the individual shall assume and bear these responsibilities\nas a fundamental of preserving the very basis of our freedom.</p>\n\n<p>Many vital changes and movements of vast proportions are taking place in\nthe economic world. The effect of these changes upon the future can not be\nseen clearly as yet. Of this, however, we are sure: Our system, based upon\nthe ideals of individual initiative and of equality of opportunity, is not\nan artificial thing. Rather it is the outgrowth of the experience of\nAmerica, and expresses the faith and spirit of our people. It has carried\nus in a century and a half to leadership of the economic world. If our\neconomic system does not match our highest expectations at all times, it\ndoes not require revolutionary action to bring it into accord with any\nnecessity that experience may prove. It has successfully adjusted itself to\nchanging conditions in the past. It will do so again. The mobility of our\ninstitutions, the richness of our resources, and the abilities of our\npeople enable us to meet them unafraid. It is a distressful time for many\nof our people, but they have shown qualities as high in fortitude, courage,\nand resourcefulness as ever in our history. With that spirit, I have faith\nthat out of it will come a sounder life, a truer standard of values, a\ngreater recognition of the results of honest effort, and a healthier\natmosphere in which to rear our children. Ours must be a country of such\nstability and security as can not fail to carry forward and enlarge among\nall the people that abundant life of material and spiritual opportunity\nwhich it has represented among all nations since its beginning.</p>\n\n<p>The White House,</p>\n\n<p>December 8, 1931\n</p>\n\t\t\t<div class="textNav"><a href="#top">^ Return to top</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>\n\t<div id="footer"><strong><em>State of the Union</em></strong> is a project\n\t\tby Brad Borevitz at <a href="http://www.onetwothree.net">onetwothree.net</a></div>\n</div>\n<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">\n</script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n_uacct = "UA-410742-1";\nurchinTracker();\n</script>\n</body>\n<!-- InstanceEnd -->\n</html>\n'
