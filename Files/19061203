There were several matters left unfinished at your\nlast session, however, which I most earnestly hope you will complete\nbefore your adjournment.</p>\n\n<p>I again recommend a law prohibiting all corporations from contributing\nto the campaign expenses of any party. Such a bill has already past one\nHouse of Congress. Let individuals contribute as they desire; but let\nus prohibit in effective fashion all corporations from making\ncontributions for any political purpose, directly or indirectly.</p>\n\n<p>Another bill which has just past one House of the Congress and which it\nis urgently necessary should be enacted into law is that conferring\nupon the Government the right of appeal in criminal cases on questions\nof law. This right exists in many of the States; it exists in the\nDistrict of Columbia by act of the Congress. It is of course not\nproposed that in any case a verdict for the defendant on the merits\nshould be set aside. Recently in one district where the Government had\nindicted certain persons for conspiracy in connection with rebates, the\ncourt sustained the defendant\'s demurrer; while in another jurisdiction\nan indictment for conspiracy to obtain rebates has been sustained by\nthe court, convictions obtained under it, and two defendants sentenced\nto imprisonment. The two cases referred to may not be in real conflict\nwith each other, but it is unfortunate that there should even be an\napparent conflict. At present there is no way by which the Government\ncan cause such a conflict, when it occurs, to be solved by an appeal to\na higher court; and the wheels of justice are blocked without any real\ndecision of the question. I can not too strongly urge the passage of\nthe bill in question. A failure to pass it will result in seriously\nhampering the Government in its effort to obtain justice, especially\nagainst wealthy individuals or corporations who do wrong; and may also\nprevent the Government from obtaining justice for wage-workers who are\nnot themselves able effectively to contest a case where the judgment of\nan inferior court has been against them. I have specifically in view a\nrecent decision by a district judge leaving railway employees without\nremedy for violation of a certain so-called labor statute. It seems an\nabsurdity to permit a single district judge, against what may be the\njudgment of the immense majority of his colleagues on the bench,\nto declare a law solemnly enacted by the Congress to be\n"unconstitutional," and then to deny to the Government the right to\nhave the Supreme Court definitely decide the question.</p>\n\n<p>It is well to recollect that the real efficiency of the law often\ndepends not upon the passage of acts as to which there is great public\nexcitement, but upon the passage of acts of this nature as to which\nthere is not much public excitement, because there is little public\nunderstanding of their importance, while the interested parties are\nkeenly alive to the desirability of defeating them. The importance of\nenacting into law the particular bill in question is further increased\nby the fact that the Government has now definitely begun a policy of\nresorting to the criminal law in those trust and interstate commerce\ncases where such a course offers a reasonable chance of success. At\nfirst, as was proper, every effort was made to enforce these laws by\ncivil proceedings; but it has become increasingly evident that the\naction of the Government in finally deciding, in certain cases, to\nundertake criminal proceedings was justifiable; and though there have\nbeen some conspicuous failures in these cases, we have had many\nsuccesses, which have undoubtedly had a deterrent effect upon\nevil-doers, whether the penalty inflicted was in the shape of fine or\nimprisonment--and penalties of both kinds have already been inflicted\nby the courts. Of course, where the judge can see his way to inflict\nthe penalty of imprisonment the deterrent effect of the punishment on\nother offenders is increased; but sufficiently heavy fines accomplish\nmuch. Judge Holt, of the New York district court, in a recent decision\nadmirably stated the need for treating with just severity offenders of\nthis kind. His opinion runs in part as follows:</p>\n\n<p>\'The Government\'s evidence to establish the defendant\'s guilt was\nclear, conclusive, and undisputed. The case was a flagrant one. The\ntransactions which took place under this illegal contract were very\nlarge; the amounts of rebates returned were considerable; and the\namount of the rebate itself was large, amounting to more than one-fifth\nof the entire tariff charge for the transportation of merchandise from\nthis city to Detroit. It is not too much to say, in my opinion, that if\nthis business was carried on for a considerable time on that\nbasis--that is, if this discrimination in favor of this particular\nshipper was made with an 18 instead of a 23 cent rate and the tariff\nrate was maintained as against their competitors--the result might be\nand not improbably would be that their competitors would be driven out\nof business. This crime is one which in its nature is deliberate and\npremeditated. I think over a fortnight elapsed between the date of\nPalmer\'s letter requesting the reduced rate and the answer of the\nrailroad company deciding to grant it, and then for months afterwards\nthis business was carried on and these claims for rebates submitted\nmonth after month and checks in payment of them drawn month after\nmonth. Such a violation of the law, in my opinion, in its essential\nnature, is a very much more heinous act than the ordinary common,\nvulgar crimes which come before criminal courts constantly for\npunishment and which arise from sudden passion or temptation. This\ncrime in this case was committed by men of education and of large\nbusiness experience, whose standing in the community was such that they\nmight have been expected to set an example of obedience to law upon the\nmaintenance of which alone in this country the security of their\nproperty depends. It was committed on behalf of a great railroad\ncorporation, which, like other railroad corporations, has received\ngratuitously from the State large and valuable privileges for the\npublic\'s convenience and its own, which performs quasi public functions\nand which is charged with the highest obligation in the transaction of\nits business to treat the citizens of this country alike, and not to\ncarry on its business with unjust discriminations between different\ncitizens or different classes of citizens. This crime in its nature is\none usually done with secrecy, and proof of which it is very difficult\nto obtain. The interstate commerce act was past in 1887, nearly twenty\nyears ago. Ever since that time complaints of the granting of rebates\nby railroads have been common, urgent, and insistent, and although the\nCongress has repeatedly past legislation endeavoring to put a stop to\nthis evil, the difficulty of obtaining proof upon which to bring\nprosecution in these cases is so great that this is the first case that\nhas ever been brought in this court, and, as I am formed, this case and\none recently brought in Philadelphia are the only cases that have ever\nbeen brought in the eastern part of this country. In fact, but few\ncases of this kind have ever been brought in this country, East or\nWest. Now, under these circumstances, I am forced to the conclusion, in\na case in which the proof is so clear and the facts are so flagrant, it\nis the duty of the court to fix a penalty which shall in some degree be\ncommensurate with the gravity of the offense. As between the two\ndefendants, in my opinion, the principal penalty should be imposed on\nthe corporation. The traffic manager in this case, presumably, acted\nwithout any advantage to himself and without any interest in the\ntransaction, either by the direct authority or in accordance with what\nhe understood to be the policy or the wishes of his employer.</p>\n\n<p>"The sentence of this court in this case is, that the defendant\nPomeroy, for each of the six offenses upon which he has been convicted,\nbe fined the sum of $1,000, making six fines, amounting in all to the\nsum of $6,000; and the defendant, The New York Central and Hudson River\nRailroad Company, for each of the six crimes of which it has been\nconvicted, be fined the sum of $18,000, making six fines amounting in\nthe aggregate to the sum of $108,000, and judgment to that effect will\nbe entered in this case."</p>\n\n<p>In connection with this matter, I would like to call attention to the\nvery unsatisfactory state of our criminal law, resulting in large part\nfrom the habit of setting aside the judgments of inferior courts on\ntechnicalities absolutely unconnected with the merits of the case, and\nwhere there is no attempt to show that there has been any failure of\nsubstantial justice. It would be well to enact a law providing\nsomething to the effect that:</p>\n\n<p>No judgment shall be set aside or new trial granted in any cause, civil\nor criminal, on the ground of misdirection of the jury or the improper\nadmission or rejection of evidence, or for error as to any matter of\npleading or procedure unless, in the opinion of the court to which the\napplication is made, after an examination of the entire cause, it shall\naffirmatively appear that the error complained of has resulted in a\nmiscarriage of justice.</p>\n\n<p>In my last message I suggested the enactment of a law in connection\nwith the issuance of injunctions, attention having been sharply drawn\nto the matter by the demand that the right of applying injunctions in\nlabor cases should be wholly abolished. It is at least doubtful whether\na law abolishing altogether the use of injunctions in such cases would\nstand the test of the courts; in which case of course the legislation\nwould be ineffective. Moreover, I believe it would be wrong altogether\nto prohibit the use of injunctions. It is criminal to permit sympathy\nfor criminals to weaken our hands in upholding the law; and if men seek\nto destroy life or property by mob violence there should be no\nimpairment of the power of the courts to deal with them in the most\nsummary and effective way possible. But so far as possible the abuse of\nthe power should be provided against by some such law as I advocated\nlast year.</p>\n\n<p>In this matter of injunctions there is lodged in the hands of the\njudiciary a necessary power which is nevertheless subject to the\npossibility of grave abuse. It is a power that should be exercised with\nextreme care and should be subject to the jealous scrutiny of all men,\nand condemnation should be meted out as much to the judge who fails to\nuse it boldly when necessary as to the judge who uses it wantonly or\noppressively. Of course a judge strong enough to be fit for his office\nwill enjoin any resort to violence or intimidation, especially by\nconspiracy, no matter what his opinion may be of the rights of the\noriginal quarrel. There must be no hesitation in dealing with disorder.\nBut there must likewise be no such abuse of the injunctive power as is\nimplied in forbidding laboring men to strive for their own betterment\nin peaceful and lawful ways; nor must the injunction be used merely to\naid some big corporation in carrying out schemes for its own\naggrandizement. It must be remembered that a preliminary injunction in\na labor case, if granted without adequate proof (even when authority\ncan be found to support the conclusions of law on which it is founded),\nmay often settle the dispute between the parties; and therefore if\nimproperly granted may do irreparable wrong. Yet there are many judges\nwho assume a matter-of-course granting of a preliminary injunction to\nbe the ordinary and proper judicial disposition of such cases; and\nthere have undoubtedly been flagrant wrongs committed by judges in\nconnection with labor disputes even within the last few years, although\nI think much less often than in former years. Such judges by their\nunwise action immensely strengthen the hands of those who are striving\nentirely to do away with the power of injunction; and therefore such\ncareless use of the injunctive process tends to threaten its very\nexistence, for if the American people ever become convinced that this\nprocess is habitually abused, whether in matters affecting labor or in\nmatters affecting corporations, it will be well-nigh impossible to\nprevent its abolition.</p>\n\n<p>It may be the highest duty of a judge at any given moment to disregard,\nnot merely the wishes of individuals of great political or financial\npower, but the overwhelming tide of public sentiment; and the judge who\ndoes thus disregard public sentiment when it is wrong, who brushes\naside the plea of any special interest when the pleading is not rounded\non righteousness, performs the highest service to the country. Such a\njudge is deserving of all honor; and all honor can not be paid to this\nwise and fearless judge if we permit the growth of an absurd convention\nwhich would forbid any criticism of the judge of another type, who\nshows himself timid in the presence of arrogant disorder, or who on\ninsufficient grounds grants an injunction that does grave injustice, or\nwho in his capacity as a construer, and therefore in part a maker, of\nthe law, in flagrant fashion thwarts the cause of decent government.\nThe judge has a power over which no review can be exercised; he himself\nsits in review upon the acts of both the executive and legislative\nbranches of the Government; save in the most extraordinary cases he is\namenable only at the bar of public opinion; and it is unwise to\nmaintain that public opinion in reference to a man with such power\nshall neither be exprest nor led.</p>\n\n<p>The best judges have ever been foremost to disclaim any immunity from\ncriticism. This has been true since the days of the great English Lord\nChancellor Parker, who said: "Let all people be at liberty to know what\nI found my judgment upon; that, so when I have given it in any cause,\nothers may be at liberty to judge of me." The proprieties of the case\nwere set forth with singular clearness and good temper by Judge W. H.\nTaft, when a United States circuit judge, eleven years ago, in 1895:</p>\n\n<p>"The opportunity freely and publicly to criticize judicial action is of\nvastly more importance to the body politic than the immunity of courts\nand judges from unjust aspersions and attack. Nothing tends more to\nrender judges careful in their decisions and anxiously solicitous to do\nexact justice than the consciousness that every act of theirs is to be\nsubjected to the intelligent scrutiny and candid criticism of their\nfellow-men. Such criticism is beneficial in proportion as it is fair,\ndispassionate, discriminating, and based on a knowledge of sound legal\nprinciples. The comments made by learned text writers and by the acute\neditors of the various law reviews upon judicial decisions are\ntherefore highly useful. Such critics constitute more or less impartial\ntribunals of professional opinion before which each judgment is made to\nstand or fall on its merits, and thus exert a strong influence to\nsecure uniformity of decision. But non-professional criticism also is\nby no means without its uses, even if accompanied, as it often is, by a\ndirect attack upon the judicial fairness and motives of the occupants\nof the bench; for if the law is but the essence of common sense, the\nprotest of many average men may evidence a defect in a judicial\nconclusion, though based on the nicest legal reasoning and profoundest\nlearning. The two important elements of moral character in a judge are\nan earnest desire to reach a just conclusion and courage to enforce it.\nIn so far as fear of public comment does not affect the courage of a\njudge, but only spurs him on to search his conscience and to reach the\nresult which approves itself to his inmost heart such comment serves a\nuseful purpose. There are few men, whether they are judges for life or\nfor a shorter term, who do not prefer to earn and hold the respect of\nall, and who can not be reached and made to pause and deliberate by\nhostile public criticism. In the case of judges having a life tenure,\nindeed their very independence makes the right freely to comment on\ntheir decisions of greater importance, because it is the only practical\nand available instrument in the hands of a free people to keep such\njudges alive to the reasonable demands of those they serve.</p>\n\n<p>"On the other hand, the danger of destroying the proper influence of\njudicial decisions by creating unfounded prejudices against the courts\njustifies and requires that unjust attacks shall be met and answered.\nCourts must ultimately rest their defense upon the inherent strength of\nthe opinions they deliver as the ground for their conclusions and must\ntrust to the calm and deliberate judgment of all the people as their\nbest vindication."</p>\n\n<p>There is one consideration which should be taken into account by the\ngood people who carry a sound proposition to an excess in objecting to\nany criticism of a judge\'s decision. The instinct of the American\npeople as a whole is sound in this matter. They will not subscribe to\nthe doctrine that any public servant is to be above all criticism. If\nthe best citizens, those most competent to express their judgment in\nsuch matters, and above all those belonging to the great and honorable\nprofession of the bar, so profoundly influential in American life, take\nthe position that there shall be no criticism of a judge under any\ncircumstances, their view will not be accepted by the American people\nas a whole. In such event the people will turn to, and tend to accept\nas justifiable, the intemperate and improper criticism uttered by\nunworthy agitators. Surely it is a misfortune to leave to such critics\na function, right, in itself, which they are certain to abuse. Just and\ntemperate criticism, when necessary, is a safeguard against the\nacceptance by the people as a whole of that intemperate antagonism\ntowards the judiciary which must be combated by every right-thinking\nman, and which, if it became widespread among the people at large,\nwould constitute a dire menace to the Republic.</p>\n\n<p>In connection with the delays of the law, I call your attention and the\nattention of the Nation to the prevalence of crime among us, and above\nall to the epidemic of lynching and mob violence that springs up, now\nin one part of our country, now in another. Each section, North, South,\nEast, or West, has its own faults; no section can with wisdom spend its\ntime jeering at the faults of another section; it should be busy trying\nto amend its own shortcomings. To deal with the crime of corruption It\nis necessary to have an awakened public conscience, and to supplement\nthis by whatever legislation will add speed and certainty in the\nexecution of the law. When we deal with lynching even mote is\nnecessary. A great many white men are lynched, but the crime is\npeculiarly frequent in respect to black men. The greatest existing\ncause of lynching is the perpetration, especially by black men, of the\nhideous crime of rape--the most abominable in all the category of\ncrimes, even worse than murder. Mobs frequently avenge the commission\nof this crime by themselves torturing to death the man committing it;\nthus avenging in bestial fashion a bestial deed, and reducing\nthemselves to a level with the criminal.</p>\n\n<p>Lawlessness grows by what it feeds upon; and when mobs begin to lynch\nfor rape they speedily extend the sphere of their operations and lynch\nfor many other kinds of crimes, so that two-thirds of the lynchings are\nnot for rape at all; while a considerable proportion of the individuals\nlynched are innocent of all crime. Governor Candler, of Georgia, stated\non one occasion some years ago: "I can say of a verity that I have,\nwithin the last month, saved the lives of half a dozen innocent Negroes\nwho were pursued by the mob, and brought them to trial in a court of\nlaw in which they were acquitted." As Bishop Galloway, of Mississippi,\nhas finely said: "When the rule of a mob obtains, that which\ndistinguishes a high civilization is surrendered. The mob which lynches\na negro charged with rape will in a little while lynch a white man\nsuspected of crime. Every Christian patriot in America needs to lift up\nhis voice in loud and eternal protest against the mob spirit that is\nthreatening the integrity of this Republic." Governor Jelks, of\nAlabama, has recently spoken as follows: "The lynching of any person\nfor whatever crime is inexcusable anywhere--it is a defiance of orderly\ngovernment; but the killing of innocent people under any provocation is\ninfinitely more horrible; and yet innocent people are likely to die\nwhen a mob\'s terrible lust is once aroused. The lesson is this: No good\ncitizen can afford to countenance a defiance of the statutes, no matter\nwhat the provocation. The innocent frequently suffer, and, it is my\nobservation, more usually suffer than the guilty. The white people of\nthe South indict the whole colored race on the ground that even the\nbetter elements lend no assistance whatever in ferreting out criminals\nof their own color. The respectable colored people must learn not to\nharbor their criminals, but to assist the officers in bringing them to\njustice. This is the larger crime, and it provokes such atrocious\noffenses as the one at Atlanta. The two races can never get on until\nthere is an understanding on the part of both to make common cause with\nthe law-abiding against criminals of any color."</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, where any crime committed by a member of one race against a\nmember of another race is avenged in such fashion that it seems as if\nnot the individual criminal, but the whole race, is attacked, the\nresult is to exasperate to the highest degree race feeling. There is\nbut one safe rule in dealing with black men as with white men; it is\nthe same rule that must be applied in dealing with rich men and poor\nmen; that is, to treat each man, whatever his color, his creed, or his\nsocial position, with even-handed justice on his real worth as a man.\nWhite people owe it quite as much to themselves as to the colored race\nto treat well the colored man who shows by his life that he deserves\nsuch treatment; for it is surely the highest wisdom to encourage in the\ncolored race all those individuals who are honest, industrious,\nlaw-abiding, and who therefore make good and safe neighbors and\ncitizens. Reward or punish the individual on his merits as an\nindividual. Evil will surely come in the end to both races if we\nsubstitute for this just rule the habit of treating all the members of\nthe race, good and bad, alike. There is no question of "social\nequality" or "negro domination" involved; only the question of\nrelentlessly punishing bad men, and of securing to the good man the\nright to his life, his liberty, and the pursuit of his happiness as his\nown qualities of heart, head, and hand enable him to achieve it.</p>\n\n<p>Every colored man should realize that the worst enemy of his race is\nthe negro criminal, and above all the negro criminal who commits the\ndreadful crime of rape; and it should be felt as in the highest degree\nan offense against the whole country, and against the colored race in\nparticular, for a colored man to fail to help the officers of the law\nin hunting down with all possible earnestness and zeal every such\ninfamous offender. Moreover, in my judgment, the crime of rape should\nalways be punished with death, as is the case with murder; assault with\nintent to commit rape should be made a capital crime, at least in the\ndiscretion of the court; and provision should be made by which the\npunishment may follow immediately upon the heels of the offense; while\nthe trial should be so conducted that the victim need not be wantonly\nshamed while giving testimony, and that the least possible publicity\nshall be given to the details.</p>\n\n<p>The members of the white race on the other hand should understand that\nevery lynching represents by just so much a loosening of the bands of\ncivilization; that the spirit of lynching inevitably throws into\nprominence in the community all the foul and evil creatures who dwell\ntherein. No man can take part in the torture of a human being without\nhaving his own moral nature permanently lowered. Every lynching means\njust so much moral deterioration in all the children who have any\nknowledge of it, and therefore just so much additional trouble for the\nnext generation of Americans.</p>\n\n<p>Let justice be both sure and swift; but let it be justice under the\nlaw, and not the wild and crooked savagery of a mob.</p>\n\n<p>There is another matter which has a direct bearing upon this matter of\nlynching and of the brutal crime which sometimes calls it forth and at\nother times merely furnishes the excuse for its existence. It is out of\nthe question for our people as a whole permanently to rise by treading\ndown any of their own number. Even those who themselves for the moment\nprofit by such maltreatment of their fellows will in the long run also\nsuffer. No more shortsighted policy can be imagined than, in the\nfancied interest of one class, to prevent the education of another\nclass. The free public school, the chance for each boy or girl to get a\ngood elementary education, lies at the foundation of our whole\npolitical situation. In every community the poorest citizens, those who\nneed the schools most, would be deprived of them if they only received\nschool facilities proportioned to the taxes they paid. This is as true\nof one portion of our country as of another. It is as true for the\nnegro as for the white man. The white man, if he is wise, will decline\nto allow the Negroes in a mass to grow to manhood and womanhood without\neducation. Unquestionably education such as is obtained in our public\nschools does not do everything towards making a man a good citizen; but\nit does much. The lowest and most brutal criminals, those for instance\nwho commit the crime of rape, are in the great majority men who have\nhad either no education or very little; just as they are almost\ninvariably men who own no property; for the man who puts money by out\nof his earnings, like the man who acquires education, is usually lifted\nabove mere brutal criminality. Of course the best type of education for\nthe colored man, taken as a whole, is such education as is conferred in\nschools like Hampton and Tuskegee; where the boys and girls, the young\nmen and young women, are trained industrially as well as in the\nordinary public school branches. The graduates of these schools turn\nout well in the great majority of cases, and hardly any of them become\ncriminals, while what little criminality there is never takes the form\nof that brutal violence which invites lynch law. Every graduate of\nthese schools--and for the matter of that every other colored man or\nwoman--who leads a life so useful and honorable as to win the good will\nand respect of those whites whose neighbor he or she is, thereby helps\nthe whole colored race as it can be helped in no other way; for next to\nthe negro himself, the man who can do most to help the negro is his\nwhite neighbor who lives near him; and our steady effort should be to\nbetter the relations between the two. Great though the benefit of these\nschools has been to their colored pupils and to the colored people, it\nmay well be questioned whether the benefit, has not been at least as\ngreat to the white people among whom these colored pupils live after\nthey graduate.</p>\n\n<p>Be it remembered, furthermore, that the individuals who, whether from\nfolly, from evil temper, from greed for office, or in a spirit of mere\nbase demagogy, indulge in the inflammatory and incendiary speeches and\nwritings which tend to arouse mobs and to bring about lynching, not\nonly thus excite the mob, but also tend by what criminologists call\n"suggestion," greatly to increase the likelihood of a repetition of the\nvery crime against which they are inveighing. When the mob is composed\nof the people of one race and the man lynched is of another race, the\nmen who in their speeches and writings either excite or justify the\naction tend, of course, to excite a bitter race feeling and to cause\nthe people of the opposite race to lose sight of the abominable act of\nthe criminal himself; and in addition, by the prominence they give to\nthe hideous deed they undoubtedly tend to excite in other brutal and\ndepraved natures thoughts of committing it. Swift, relentless, and\norderly punishment under the law is the only way by which criminality\nof this type can permanently be supprest.</p>\n\n<p>In dealing with both labor and capital, with the questions affecting\nboth corporations and trades unions, there is one matter more important\nto remember than aught else, and that is the infinite harm done by\npreachers of mere discontent. These are the men who seek to excite a\nviolent class hatred against all men of wealth. They seek to turn wise\nand proper movements for the better control of corporations and for\ndoing away with the abuses connected with wealth, into a campaign of\nhysterical excitement and falsehood in which the aim is to inflame to\nmadness the brutal passions of mankind. The sinister demagogs and\nfoolish visionaries who are always eager to undertake such a campaign\nof destruction sometimes seek to associate themselves with those\nworking for a genuine reform in governmental and social methods, and\nsometimes masquerade as such reformers. In reality they are the worst\nenemies of the cause they profess to advocate, just as the purveyors of\nsensational slander in newspaper or magazine are the worst enemies of\nall men who are engaged in an honest effort to better what is bad in\nour social and governmental conditions. To preach hatred of the rich\nman as such, to carry on a campaign of slander and invective against\nhim, to seek to mislead and inflame to madness honest men whose lives\nare hard and who have not the kind of mental training which will permit\nthem to appreciate the danger in the doctrines preached--all this is to\ncommit a crime against the body politic and to be false to every worthy\nprinciple and tradition of American national life. Moreover, while such\npreaching and such agitation may give a livelihood and a certain\nnotoriety to some of those who take part in it, and may result in the\ntemporary political success of others, in the long run every such\nmovement will either fail or else will provoke a violent reaction,\nwhich will itself result not merely in undoing the mischief wrought by\nthe demagog and the agitator, but also in undoing the good that the\nhonest reformer, the true upholder of popular rights, has painfully and\nlaboriously achieved. Corruption is never so rife as in communities\nwhere the demagog and the agitator bear full sway, because in such\ncommunities all moral bands become loosened, and hysteria and\nsensationalism replace the spirit of sound judgment and fair dealing as\nbetween man and man. In sheer revolt against the squalid anarchy thus\nproduced men are sure in the end to turn toward any leader who can\nrestore order, and then their relief at being free from the intolerable\nburdens of class hatred, violence, and demagogy is such that they can\nnot for some time be aroused to indignation against misdeeds by men of\nwealth; so that they permit a new growth of the very abuses which were\nin part responsible for the original outbreak. The one hope for success\nfor our people lies in a resolute and fearless, but sane and\ncool-headed, advance along the path marked out last year by this very\nCongress. There must be a stern refusal to be misled into following\neither that base creature who appeals and panders to the lowest\ninstincts and passions in order to arouse one set of Americans against\ntheir fellows, or that other creature, equally base but no baser, who\nin a spirit of greed, or to accumulate or add to an already huge\nfortune, seeks to exploit his fellow Americans with callous disregard\nto their welfare of soul and body. The man who debauches others in\norder to obtain a high office stands on an evil equality of corruption\nwith the man who debauches others for financial profit; and when hatred\nis sown the crop which springs up can only be evil.</p>\n\n<p>The plain people who think--the mechanics, farmers, merchants, workers\nwith head or hand, the men to whom American traditions are dear, who\nlove their country and try to act decently by their neighbors, owe it\nto themselves to remember that the most damaging blow that can be given\npopular government is to elect an unworthy and sinister agitator on a\nplatform of violence and hypocrisy. Whenever such an issue is raised in\nthis country nothing can be gained by flinching from it, for in such\ncase democracy is itself on trial, popular self-government under\nrepublican forms is itself on trial. The triumph of the mob is just as\nevil a thing as the triumph of the plutocracy, and to have escaped one\ndanger avails nothing whatever if we succumb to the other. In the end\nthe honest man, whether rich or poor, who earns his own living and\ntries to deal justly by his fellows, has as much to fear from the\ninsincere and unworthy demagog, promising much and performing nothing,\nor else performing nothing but evil, who would set on the mob to\nplunder the rich, as from the crafty corruptionist, who, for his own\nends, would permit the common people to be exploited by the very\nwealthy. If we ever let this Government fall into the hands of men of\neither of these two classes, we shall show ourselves false to America\'s\npast. Moreover, the demagog and the corruptionist often work hand in\nhand. There are at this moment wealthy reactionaries of such obtuse\nmorality that they regard the public servant who prosecutes them when\nthey violate the law, or who seeks to make them bear their proper share\nof the public burdens, as being even more objectionable than the\nviolent agitator who hounds on the mob to plunder the rich. There is\nnothing to choose between such a reactionary and such an agitator;\nfundamentally they are alike in their selfish disregard of the rights\nof others; and it is natural that they should join in opposition to any\nmovement of which the aim is fearlessly to do exact and even justice to\nall.</p>\n\n<p>I call your attention to the need of passing the bill limiting the\nnumber of hours of employment of railroad employees. The measure is a\nvery moderate one and I can conceive of no serious objection to it.\nIndeed, so far as it is in our power, it should be our aim steadily to\nreduce the number of hours of labor, with as a goal the general\nintroduction of an eight-hour day. There are industries in which it is\nnot possible that the hours of labor should be reduced; just as there\nare communities not far enough advanced for such a movement to be for\ntheir good, or, if in the Tropics, so situated that there is no analogy\nbetween their needs and ours in this matter. On the Isthmus of Panama,\nfor instance, the conditions are in every way so different from what\nthey are here that an eight-hour day would be absurd; just as it is\nabsurd, so far as the Isthmus is concerned, where white labor can not\nbe employed, to bother as to whether the necessary work is done by\nalien black men or by alien yellow men. But the wageworkers of the\nUnited States are of so high a grade that alike from the merely\nindustrial standpoint and from the civic standpoint it should be our\nobject to do what we can in the direction of securing the general\nobservance of an eight-hour day. Until recently the eight-hour law on\nour Federal statute books has been very scantily observed. Now,\nhowever, largely through the instrumentality of the Bureau of Labor, it\nis being rigidly enforced, and I shall speedily be able to say whether\nor not there is need of further legislation in reference thereto; .for\nour purpose is to see it obeyed in spirit no less than in letter. Half\nholidays during summer should be established for Government employees;\nit is as desirable for wageworkers who toil with their hands as for\nsalaried officials whose labor is mental that there should be a\nreasonable amount of holiday.</p>\n\n<p>The Congress at its last session wisely provided for a truant court for\nthe District of Columbia; a marked step in advance on the path of\nproperly caring for the children. Let me again urge that the Congress\nprovide for a thorough investigation of the conditions of child labor\nand of the labor of women in the United States. More and more our\npeople are growing to recognize the fact that the questions which are\nnot merely of industrial but of social importance outweigh all others;\nand these two questions most emphatically come in the category of those\nwhich affect in the most far-reaching way the home life of the Nation.\nThe horrors incident to the employment of young children in factories\nor at work anywhere are a blot on our civilization. It is true that\neach. State must ultimately settle the question in its own way; but a\nthorough official investigation of the matter, with the results\npublished broadcast, would greatly help toward arousing the public\nconscience and securing unity of State action in the matter. There is,\nhowever, one law on the subject which should be enacted immediately,\nbecause there is no need for an investigation in reference thereto, and\nthe failure to enact it is discreditable to the National Government. A\ndrastic and thoroughgoing child-labor law should be enacted for the\nDistrict of Columbia and the Territories.</p>\n\n<p>Among the excellent laws which the Congress past at the last session\nwas an employers\' liability law. It was a marked step in advance to get\nthe recognition of employers\' liability on the statute books; but the\nlaw did not go far enough. In spite of all precautions exercised by\nemployers there are unavoidable accidents and even deaths involved in\nnearly every line of business connected with the mechanic arts. This\ninevitable sacrifice of life may be reduced to a minimum, but it can\nnot be completely eliminated. It is a great social injustice to compel\nthe employee, or rather the family of the killed or disabled victim, to\nbear the entire burden of such an inevitable sacrifice. In other words,\nsociety shirks its duty by laying the whole cost on the victim, whereas\nthe injury comes from what may be called the legitimate risks of the\ntrade. Compensation for accidents or deaths due in any line of industry\nto the actual conditions under which that industry is carried on,\nshould be paid by that portion of the community for the benefit of\nwhich the industry is carried on--that is, by those who profit by the\nindustry. If the entire trade risk is placed upon the employer he will\npromptly and properly add it to the legitimate cost of production and\nassess it proportionately upon the consumers of his commodity. It is\ntherefore clear to my mind that the law should place this entire "risk\nof a trade" upon the employer. Neither the Federal law, nor, as far as\nI am informed, the State laws dealing with the question of employers\'\nliability are sufficiently thoroughgoing. The Federal law should of\ncourse include employees in navy-yards, arsenals, and the like.</p>\n\n<p>The commission appointed by the President October 16, 1902, at the\nrequest of both the anthracite coal operators and miners, to inquire\ninto, consider, and pass upon the questions in controversy in\nconnection with the strike in the anthracite regions of Pennsylvania\nand the causes out of which the controversy arose, in their report,\nfindings, and award exprest the belief "that the State and Federal\ngovernments should provide the machinery for what may be called the\ncompulsory investigation of controversies between employers and\nemployees when they arise." This expression of belief is deserving of\nthe favorable consideration of the Congress and the enactment of its\nprovisions into law. A bill has already been introduced to this end.</p>\n\n<p>Records show that during the twenty years from January 1, 1881, to,\nDecember 31, 1900, there were strikes affecting 117,509 establishments,\nand 6,105,694 employees were thrown out of employment. During the same\nperiod there were 1,005 lockouts, involving nearly 10,000\nestablishments, throwing over one million people out of employment.\nThese strikes and lockouts involved an estimated loss to employees of\n$307,000,000 and to employers of $143,000,000, a total of $450,000,000.\nThe public suffered directly and indirectly probably as great\nadditional loss. But the money loss, great as it was, did not measure\nthe anguish and suffering endured by the wives and children of\nemployees whose pay stopt when their work stopt, or the disastrous\neffect of the strike or lockout upon the business of employers, or the\nincrease in the cost of products and the inconvenience and loss to the\npublic.</p>\n\n<p>Many of these strikes and lockouts would not have occurred had the\nparties to the dispute been required to appear before an unprejudiced\nbody representing the nation and, face to face, state the reasons for\ntheir contention. In most instances the dispute would doubtless be\nfound to be due to a misunderstanding by each of the other\'s rights,\naggravated by an unwillingness of either party to accept as true the\nstatements of the other as to the justice or injustice of the matters\nin dispute. The exercise of a judicial spirit by a disinterested body\nrepresenting the Federal Government, such as would be provided by a\ncommission on conciliation and arbitration, would tend to create an\natmosphere of friendliness and conciliation between contending parties;\nand the giving each side an equal opportunity to present fully its case\nin the presence of the other would prevent many disputes from\ndeveloping into serious strikes or lockouts, and, in other cases, would\nenable the commission to persuade the opposing parties to come to\nterms.</p>\n\n<p>In this age of great corporate and labor combinations, neither\nemployers nor employees should be left completely at the mercy of the\nstronger party to a dispute, regardless of the righteousness of their\nrespective claims. The proposed measure would be in the line of\nsecuring recognition of the fact that in many strikes the public has\nitself an interest which can not wisely be disregarded; an interest not\nmerely of general convenience, for the question of a just and proper\npublic policy must also be considered. In all legislation of this kind\nit is well to advance cautiously, testing each step by the actual\nresults; the step proposed can surely be safely taken, for the\ndecisions of the commission would not bind the parties in legal\nfashion, and yet would give a chance for public opinion to crystallize\nand thus to exert its full force for the right.</p>\n\n<p>It is not wise that the Nation should alienate its remaining coal\nlands. I have temporarily withdrawn from settlement all the lands which\nthe Geological Survey has indicated as containing, or in all\nprobability containing, coal. The question, however, can be properly\nsettled only by legislation, which in my judgment should provide for\nthe withdrawal of these lands from sale or from entry, save in certain\nespecial circumstances. The ownership would then remain in the United\nStates, which should not, however, attempt to work them, but permit\nthem to be worked by private individuals under a royalty system, the\nGovernment keeping such control as to permit it to see that no\nexcessive price was charged consumers. It would, of course, be as\nnecessary to supervise the rates charged by the common carriers to\ntransport the product as the rates charged by those who mine it; and\nthe supervision must extend to the conduct of the common carriers, so\nthat they shall in no way favor one competitor at the expense of\nanother. The withdrawal of these coal lands would constitute a policy\nanalogous to that which has been followed in withdrawing the forest\nlands from ordinary settlement. The coal, like the forests, should be\ntreated as the property of the public and its disposal should be under\nconditions which would inure to the benefit of the public as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>The present Congress has taken long strides in the direction of\nsecuring proper supervision and control by the National Government over\ncorporations engaged in interstate business and the enormous majority\nof corporations of any size are engaged in interstate business. The\npassage of the railway rate bill, and only to a less degree the passage\nof the pure food bill, and the provision for increasing and rendering\nmore effective national control over the beef-packing industry, mark an\nimportant advance in the proper direction. In the short session it will\nperhaps be difficult to do much further along this line; and it may be\nbest to wait until the laws have been in operation for a number of\nmonths before endeavoring to increase their scope, because only\noperation will show with exactness their merits and their shortcomings\nand thus give opportunity to define what further remedial legislation\nis needed. Yet in my judgment it will in the end be advisable in\nconnection with the packing house inspection law to provide for putting\na date on the label and for charging the cost of inspection to the\npackers. All these laws have already justified their enactment. The\ninterstate commerce law, for instance, has rather amusingly falsified\nthe predictions, both of those who asserted that it would ruin the\nrailroads and of those who asserted that it did not go far enough and\nwould accomplish nothing. During the last five months the railroads\nhave shown increased earnings and some of them unusual dividends; while\nduring the same period the mere taking effect of the law has produced\nan unprecedented, a hitherto unheard of, number of voluntary reductions\nin freights and fares by the railroads. Since the founding of the\nCommission there has never been a time of equal length in which\nanything like so many reduced tariffs have been put into effect. On\nAugust 27, for instance, two days before the new law went into effect,\nthe Commission received notices of over five thousand separate tariffs\nwhich represented reductions from previous rates.</p>\n\n<p>It must not be supposed, however, that with the passage of these laws\nit will be possible to stop progress along the line of increasing the\npower of the National Government over the use of capital interstate\ncommerce. For example, there will ultimately be need of enlarging the\npowers of the Interstate Commerce Commission along several different\nlines, so as to give it a larger and more efficient control over the\nrailroads.</p>\n\n<p>It can not too often be repeated that experience has conclusively shown\nthe impossibility of securing by the actions of nearly half a hundred\ndifferent State legislatures anything but ineffective chaos in the way\nof dealing with the great corporations which do not operate exclusively\nwithin the limits of any one State. In some method, whether by a\nnational license law or in other fashion, we must exercise, and that at\nan early date, a far more complete control than at present over these\ngreat corporations--a control that will among other things prevent the\nevils of excessive overcapitalization, and that will compel the\ndisclosure by each big corporation of its stockholders and of its\nproperties and business, whether owned directly or through subsidiary\nor affiliated corporations. This will tend to put a stop to the\nsecuring of inordinate profits by favored individuals at the expense\nwhether of the general public, the stockholders, or the wageworkers.\nOur effort should be not so much to prevent consolidation as such, but\nso to supervise and control it as to see that it results in no harm to\nthe people. The reactionary or ultraconservative apologists for the\nmisuse of wealth assail the effort to secure such control as a step\ntoward socialism. As a matter of fact it is these reactionaries and\nultraconservatives who are themselves most potent in increasing\nsocialistic feeling. One of the most efficient methods of averting the\nconsequences of a dangerous agitation, which is 80 per cent wrong, is\nto remedy the 20 per cent of evil as to which the agitation is well\nrounded. The best way to avert the very undesirable move for the\ngovernment ownership of railways is to secure by the Government on\nbehalf of the people as a whole such adequate control and regulation of\nthe great interstate common carriers as will do away with the evils\nwhich give rise to the agitation against them. So the proper antidote\nto the dangerous and wicked agitation against the men of wealth as such\nis to secure by proper legislation and executive action the abolition\nof the grave abuses which actually do obtain in connection with the\nbusiness use of wealth under our present system--or rather no\nsystem--of failure to exercise any adequate control at all. Some\npersons speak as if the exercise of such governmental control would do\naway with the freedom of individual initiative and dwarf individual\neffort. This is not a fact. It would be a veritable calamity to fail to\nput a premium upon individual initiative, individual capacity and\neffort; upon the energy, character, and foresight which it is so\nimportant to encourage in the individual. But as a matter of fact the\ndeadening and degrading effect of pure socialism, and especially of its\nextreme form communism, and the destruction of individual character\nwhich they would bring about, are in part achieved by the wholly\nunregulated competition which results in a single individual or\ncorporation rising at the expense of all others until his or its rise\neffectually checks all competition and reduces former competitors to a\nposition of utter inferiority and subordination.</p>\n\n<p>In enacting and enforcing such legislation as this Congress already has\nto its credit, we are working on a coherent plan, with the steady\nendeavor to secure the needed reform by the joint action of the\nmoderate men, the plain men who do not wish anything hysterical or\ndangerous, but who do intend to deal in resolute common-sense fashion\nwith the real and great evils of the present system. The reactionaries\nand the violent extremists show symptoms of joining hands against us.\nBoth assert, for instance, that, if logical, we should go to government\nownership of railroads and the like; the reactionaries, because on such\nan issue they think the people would stand with them, while the\nextremists care rather to preach discontent and agitation than to\nachieve solid results. As a matter of fact, our position is as remote\nfrom that of the Bourbon reactionary as from that of the impracticable\nor sinister visionary. We hold that the Government should not conduct\nthe business of the nation, but that it should exercise such\nsupervision as will insure its being conducted in the interest of the\nnation. Our aim is, so far as may be, to secure, for all decent, hard\nworking men, equality of opportunity and equality of burden.</p>\n\n<p>The actual working of our laws has shown that the effort to prohibit\nall combination, good or bad, is noxious where it is not ineffective.\nCombination of capital like combination of labor is a necessary element\nof our present industrial system. It is not possible completely to\nprevent it; and if it were possible, such complete prevention would do\ndamage to the body politic. What we need is not vainly to try to\nprevent all combination, but to secure such rigorous and adequate\ncontrol and supervision of the combinations as to prevent their\ninjuring the public, or existing in such form as inevitably to threaten\ninjury--for the mere fact that a combination has secured practically\ncomplete control of a necessary of life would under any circumstances\nshow that such combination was to be presumed to be adverse to the\npublic interest. It is unfortunate that our present laws should forbid\nall combinations, instead of sharply discriminating between those\ncombinations which do good and those combinations which do evil.\nRebates, for instance, are as often due to the pressure of big shippers\n(as was shown in the investigation of the Standard Oil Company and as\nhas been shown since by the investigation of the tobacco and sugar\ntrusts) as to the initiative of big railroads. Often railroads would\nlike to combine for the purpose of preventing a big shipper from\nmaintaining improper advantages at the expense of small shippers and of\nthe general public. Such a combination, instead of being forbidden by\nlaw, should be favored. In other words, it should be permitted to\nrailroads to make agreements, provided these agreements were sanctioned\nby the Interstate Commerce Commission and were published. With these\ntwo conditions complied with it is impossible to see what harm such a\ncombination could do to the public at large. It is a public evil to\nhave on the statute books a law incapable of full enforcement because\nboth judges and juries realize that its full enforcement would destroy\nthe business of the country; for the result is to make decent railroad\nmen violators of the law against their will, and to put a premium on\nthe behavior of the wilful wrongdoers. Such a result in turn tends to\nthrow the decent man and the wilful wrongdoer into close association,\nand in the end to drag down the former to the latter\'s level; for the\nman who becomes a lawbreaker in one way unhappily tends to lose all\nrespect for law and to be willing to break it in many ways. No more\nscathing condemnation could be visited upon a law than is contained in\nthe words of the Interstate Commerce Commission when, in commenting\nupon the fact that the numerous joint traffic associations do\ntechnically violate the law, they say: "The decision of the United\nStates Supreme Court in the Trans-Missouri case and the Joint Traffic\nAssociation case has produced no practical effect upon the railway\noperations of the country. Such associations, in fact, exist now as\nthey did before these decisions, and with the same general effect. In\njustice to all parties, we ought probably to add that it is difficult\nto see how our interstate railways could be operated with due regard to\nthe interest of the shipper and the railway without concerted action of\nthe kind afforded through these associations."</p>\n\n<p>This means that the law as construed by the Supreme Court is such that\nthe business of the country can not be conducted without breaking it. I\nrecommend that you give careful and early consideration to this\nsubject, and if you find the opinion of the Interstate Commerce\nCommission justified, that you amend the law so as to obviate the evil\ndisclosed.</p>\n\n<p>The question of taxation is difficult in any country, but it is\nespecially difficult in ours with its Federal system of government.\nSome taxes should on every ground be levied in a small district for use\nin that district. Thus the taxation of real estate is peculiarly one\nfor the immediate locality in which the real estate is found. Again,\nthere is no more legitimate tax for any State than a tax on the\nfranchises conferred by that State upon street railroads and similar\ncorporations which operate wholly within the State boundaries,\nsometimes in one and sometimes in several municipalities or other minor\ndivisions of the State. But there are many kinds of taxes which can\nonly be levied by the General Government so as to produce the best\nresults, because, among other reasons, the attempt to impose them in\none particular State too often results merely in driving the\ncorporation or individual affected to some other locality or other\nState. The National Government has long derived its chief revenue from\na tariff on imports and from an internal or excise tax. In addition to\nthese there is every reason why, when next our system of taxation is\nrevised, the National Government should impose a graduated inheritance\ntax, and, if possible, a graduated income tax. The man of great wealth\nowes a peculiar obligation to the State, because he derives special\nadvantages from the mere existence of government. Not only should he\nrecognize this obligation in the way he leads his daily life and in the\nway he earns and spends his money, but it should also be recognized by\nthe way in which he pays for the protection the State gives him. On the\none hand, it is desirable that he should assume his full and proper\nshare of the burden of taxation; on the other hand, it is quite as\nnecessary that in this kind of taxation, where the men who vote the tax\npay but little of it, there should be clear recognition of the danger\nof inaugurating any such system save in a spirit of entire justice and\nmoderation. Whenever we, as a people, undertake to remodel our taxation\nsystem along the lines suggested, we must make it clear beyond\nperadventure that our aim is to distribute the burden of supporting the\nGovernment more equitably than at present; that we intend to treat rich\nman and poor man on a basis of absolute equality, and that we regard it\nas equally fatal to true democracy to do or permit injustice to the one\nas to do or permit injustice to the other.</p>\n\n<p>I am well aware that such a subject as this needs long and careful\nstudy in order that the people may become familiar with what is\nproposed to be done, may clearly see the necessity of proceeding with\nwisdom and self-restraint, and may make up their minds just how far\nthey are willing to go in the matter; while only trained legislators\ncan work out the project in necessary detail. But I feel that in the\nnear future our national legislators should enact a law providing for a\ngraduated inheritance tax by which a steadily increasing rate of duty\nshould be put upon all moneys or other valuables coming by gift,\nbequest, or devise to any individual or corporation. It may be well to\nmake the tax heavy in proportion as the individual benefited is remote\nof kin. In any event, in my judgment the pro rata of the tax should\nincrease very heavily with the increase of the amount left to any one\nindividual after a certain point has been reached. It is most desirable\nto encourage thrift and ambition, and a potent source of thrift and\nambition is the desire on the part of the breadwinner to leave his\nchildren well off. This object can be attained by making the tax very\nsmall on moderate amounts of property left; because the prime object\nshould be to put a constantly increasing burden on the inheritance of\nthose swollen fortunes which it is certainly of no benefit to this\ncountry to perpetuate.</p>\n\n<p>There can be no question of the ethical propriety of the Government\nthus determining the conditions upon which any gift or inheritance\nshould be received. Exactly how far the inheritance tax would, as an\nincident, have the effect of limiting the transmission by devise or\ngift of the enormous fortunes in question it is not necessary at\npresent to discuss. It is wise that progress in this direction should\nbe gradual. At first a permanent national inheritance tax, while it\nmight be more substantial than any such tax has hitherto been, need not\napproximate, either in amount or in the extent of the increase by\ngraduation, to what such a tax should ultimately be.</p>\n\n<p>This species of tax has again and again been imposed, although only\ntemporarily, by the National Government. It was first imposed by the\nact of July 6, 1797, when the makers of the Constitution were alive and\nat the head of affairs. It was a graduated tax; though small in amount,\nthe rate was increased with the amount left to any individual,\nexceptions being made in the case of certain close kin. A similar tax\nwas again imposed by the act of July 1, 1862; a minimum sum of one\nthousand dollars in personal property being excepted from taxation, the\ntax then becoming progressive according to the remoteness of kin. The\nwar-revenue act of June 13, 1898, provided for an inheritance tax on\nany sum exceeding the value of ten thousand dollars, the rate of the\ntax increasing both in accordance with the amounts left and in\naccordance with the legatee\'s remoteness of kin. The Supreme Court has\nheld that the succession tax imposed at the time of the Civil War was\nnot a direct tax but an impost or excise which was both constitutional\nand valid. More recently the Court, in an opinion delivered by Mr.\nJustice White, which contained an exceedingly able and elaborate\ndiscussion of the powers of the Congress to impose death duties,\nsustained the constitutionality of the inheritance-tax feature of the\nwar-revenue act of 1898.</p>\n\n<p>In its incidents, and apart from the main purpose of raising revenue,\nan income tax stands on an entirely different footing from an\ninheritance tax; because it involves no question of the perpetuation of\nfortunes swollen to an unhealthy size. The question is in its essence a\nquestion of the proper adjustment of burdens to benefits. As the law\nnow stands it is undoubtedly difficult to devise a national income tax\nwhich shall be constitutional. But whether it is absolutely impossible\nis another question; and if possible it is most certainly desirable.\nThe first purely income-tax law was past by the Congress in 1861, but\nthe most important law dealing with the subject was that of 1894. This\nthe court held to be unconstitutional.</p>\n\n<p>The question is undoubtedly very intricate, delicate, and troublesome.\nThe decision of the court was only reached by one majority. It is the\nlaw of the land, and of course is accepted as such and loyally obeyed\nby all good citizens. Nevertheless, the hesitation evidently felt by\nthe court as a whole in coming to a conclusion, when considered\ntogether with the previous decisions on the subject, may perhaps\nindicate the possibility of devising a constitutional income-tax law\nwhich shall substantially accomplish the results aimed at. The\ndifficulty of amending the Constitution is so great that only real\nnecessity can justify a resort thereto. Every effort should be made in\ndealing with this subject, as with the subject of the proper control by\nthe National Government over the use of corporate wealth in interstate\nbusiness, to devise legislation which without such action shall attain\nthe desired end; but if this fails, there will ultimately be no\nalternative to a constitutional amendment.</p>\n\n<p>It would be impossible to overstate (though it is of course difficult\nquantitatively to measure) the effect upon a nation\'s growth to\ngreatness of what may be called organized patriotism, which necessarily\nincludes the substitution of a national feeling for mere local pride;\nwith as a resultant a high ambition for the whole country. No country\ncan develop its full strength so long as the parts which make up the\nwhole each put a feeling of loyalty to the part above the feeling of\nloyalty to the whole. This is true of sections and it is just as true\nof classes. The industrial and agricultural classes must work together,\ncapitalists and wageworkers must work together, if the best work of\nwhich the country is capable is to be done. It is probable that a\nthoroughly efficient system of education comes next to the influence of\npatriotism in bringing about national success of this kind. Our federal\nform of government, so fruitful of advantage to our people in certain\nways, in other ways undoubtedly limits our national effectiveness. It\nis not possible, for instance, for the National Government to take the\nlead in technical industrial education, to see that the public school\nsystem of this country develops on all its technical, industrial,\nscientific, and commercial sides. This must be left primarily to the\nseveral States. Nevertheless, the National Government has control of\nthe schools of the District of Columbia, and it should see that these\nschools promote and encourage the fullest development of the scholars\nin both commercial and industrial training. The commercial training\nshould in one of its branches deal with foreign trade. The industrial\ntraining is even more important. It should be one of our prime objects\nas a Nation, so far as feasible, constantly to work toward putting the\nmechanic, the wageworker who works with his hands, on a higher plane of\nefficiency and reward, so as to increase his effectiveness in the\neconomic world, and the dignity, the remuneration, and the power of his\nposition in the social world. Unfortunately, at present the effect of\nsome of the work in the public schools is in the exactly opposite\ndirection. If boys and girls are trained merely in literary\naccomplishments, to the total exclusion of industrial, manual, and\ntechnical training, the tendency is to unfit them for industrial work\nand to make them reluctant to go into it, or unfitted to do well if\nthey do go into it. This is a tendency which should be strenuously\ncombated. Our industrial development depends largely upon technical\neducation, including in this term all industrial education, from that\nwhich fits a man to be a good mechanic, a good carpenter, or\nblacksmith, to that which fits a man to do the greatest engineering\nfeat. The skilled mechanic, the skilled workman, can best become such\nby technical industrial education. The far-reaching usefulness of\ninstitutes of technology and schools of mines or of engineering is now\nuniversally acknowledged, and no less far--reaching is the effect of a\ngood building or mechanical trades school, a textile, or watch-making,\nor engraving school. All such training must develop not only manual\ndexterity but industrial intelligence. In international rivalry this\ncountry does not have to fear the competition of pauper labor as much\nas it has to fear the educated labor of specially trained competitors;\nand we should have the education of the hand, eye, and brain which will\nfit us to meet such competition.</p>\n\n<p>In every possible way we should help the wageworker who toils with his\nhands and who must (we hope in a constantly increasing measure) also\ntoil with his brain. Under the Constitution the National Legislature\ncan do but little of direct importance for his welfare save where he is\nengaged in work which permits it to act under the interstate commerce\nclause of the Constitution; and this is one reason why I so earnestly\nhope that both the legislative and judicial branches of the Government\nwill construe this clause of the Constitution in the broadest possible\nmanner. We can, however, in such a matter as industrial training, in\nsuch a matter as child labor and factory laws, set an example to the\nStates by enacting the most advanced legislation that can wisely be\nenacted for the District of Columbia.</p>\n\n<p>The only other persons whose welfare is as vital to the welfare of the\nwhole country as is the welfare of the wageworkers are the tillers of\nthe soil, the farmers. It is a mere truism to say that no growth of\ncities, no growth of wealth, no industrial development can atone for\nany falling off in the character and standing of the farming\npopulation. During the last few decades this fact has been recognized\nwith ever-increasing clearness. There is no longer any failure to\nrealize that farming, at least in certain branches, must become a\ntechnical and scientific profession. This means that there must be open\nto farmers the chance for technical and scientific training, not\ntheoretical merely but of the most severely practical type. The farmer\nrepresents a peculiarly high type of American citizenship, and he must\nhave the same chance to rise and develop as other American citizens\nhave. Moreover, it is exactly as true of the farmer, as it is of the\nbusiness man and the wageworker, that the ultimate success of the\nNation of which he forms a part must be founded not alone on material\nprosperity but upon high moral, mental, and physical development. This\neducation of the farmer--self-education by preference but also\neducation from the outside, as with all other men--is peculiarly\nnecessary here in the United States, where the frontier conditions even\nin the newest States have now nearly vanished, where there must be a\nsubstitution of a more intensive system of cultivation for the old\nwasteful farm management, and where there must be a better business\norganization among the farmers themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Several factors must cooperate in the improvement of the farmer\'s\ncondition. He must have the chance to be educated in the widest\npossible sense--in the sense which keeps ever in view the intimate\nrelationship between the theory of education and the facts of life. In\nall education we should widen our aims. It is a good thing to produce a\ncertain number of trained scholars and students; but the education\nsuperintended by the State must seek rather to produce a hundred good\ncitizens than merely one scholar, and it must be turned now and then\nfrom the class book to the study of the great book of nature itself.\nThis is especially true of the farmer, as has been pointed out again\nand again by all observers most competent to pass practical judgment on\nthe problems of our country life. All students now realize that\neducation must seek to train the executive powers of young people and\nto confer more real significance upon the phrase "dignity of labor,"\nand to prepare the pupils so that, in addition to each developing in\nthe highest degree his individual capacity for work, they may together\nhelp create a right public opinion, and show in many ways social and\ncooperative spirit. Organization has become necessary in the business\nworld; and it has accomplished much for good in the world of labor. It\nis no less necessary for farmers. Such a movement as the grange\nmovement is good in itself and is capable of a well-nigh infinite\nfurther extension for good so long as it is kept to its own legitimate\nbusiness. The benefits to be derived by the association of farmers for\nmutual advantage are partly economic and partly sociological.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, while in the long run voluntary efforts will prove more\nefficacious than government assistance, while the farmers must\nprimarily do most for themselves, yet the Government can also do much.\nThe Department of Agriculture has broken new ground in many directions,\nand year by year it finds how it can improve its methods and develop\nfresh usefulness. Its constant effort is to give the governmental\nassistance in the most effective way; that is, through associations of\nfarmers rather than to or through individual farmers. It is also\nstriving to coordinate its work with the agricultural departments of\nthe several States, and so far as its own work is educational to\ncoordinate it with the work of other educational authorities.\nAgricultural education is necessarily based upon general education, but\nour agricultural educational institutions are wisely specializing\nthemselves, making their courses relate to the actual teaching of the\nagricultural and kindred sciences to young country people or young city\npeople who wish to live in the country.</p>\n\n<p>Great progress has already been made among farmers by the creation of\nfarmers\' institutes, of dairy associations, of breeders\' associations,\nhorticultural associations, and the like. A striking example of how the\nGovernment and the farmers can cooperate is shown in connection with\nthe menace offered to the cotton growers of the Southern States by the\nadvance of the boll weevil. The Department is doing all it can to\norganize the farmers in the threatened districts, just as it has been\ndoing all it can to organize them in aid of its work to eradicate the\ncattle fever tick in the South. The Department can and will cooperate\nwith all such associations, and it must have their help if its own work\nis to be done in the most efficient style.</p>\n\n<p>Much is now being done for the States of the Rocky Mountains and Great\nPlains through the development of the national policy of irrigation and\nforest preservation; no Government policy for the betterment of our\ninternal conditions has been more fruitful of good than this. The\nforests of the White Mountains and Southern Appalachian regions should\nalso be preserved; and they can not be unless the people of the States\nin which they lie, through their representatives in the Congress,\nsecure vigorous action by the National Government.</p>\n\n<p>I invite the attention of the Congress to the estimate of the Secretary\nof War for an appropriation to enable him to begin the preliminary work\nfor the construction of a memorial amphitheater at Arlington. The Grand\nArmy of the Republic in its national encampment has urged the erection\nof such an amphitheater as necessary for the proper observance Of\nMemorial Day and as a fitting monument to the soldier and sailor dead\nburied there. In this I heartily concur and commend the matter to the\nfavorable consideration of the Congress.</p>\n\n<p>I am well aware of how difficult it is to pass a constitutional\namendment. Nevertheless in my judgment the whole question of marriage\nand divorce should be relegated to the authority of the National\nCongress. At present the wide differences in the laws of the different\nStates on this subject result in scandals and abuses; and surely there\nis nothing so vitally essential to the welfare of the nation, nothing\naround which the nation should so bend itself to throw every safeguard,\nas the home life of the average citizen. The change would be good from\nevery standpoint. In particular it would be good because it would\nconfer on the Congress the power at once to deal radically and\nefficiently with polygamy; and this should be done whether or not\nmarriage and divorce are dealt with. It is neither safe nor proper to\nleave the question of polygamy to be dealt with by the several States.\nPower to deal with it should be conferred on the National Government.</p>\n\n<p>When home ties are loosened; when men and women cease to regard a\nworthy family life, with all its duties fully performed, and all its\nresponsibilities lived up to, as the life best worth living; then evil\ndays for the commonwealth are at hand. There are regions in our land,\nand classes of our population, where the birth rate has sunk below the\ndeath rate. Surely it should need no demonstration to show that wilful\nsterility is, from the standpoint of the nation, from the standpoint of\nthe human race, the one sin for which the penalty is national death,\nrace death; a sin for which there is no atonement; a sin which is the\nmore dreadful exactly in proportion as the men and women guilty thereof\nare in other respects, in character, and bodily and mental powers,\nthose whom for the sake of the state it would be well to see the\nfathers and mothers of many healthy children, well brought up in homes\nmade happy by their presence. No man, no woman, can shirk the primary\nduties of life, whether for love of ease and pleasure, or for any other\ncause, and retain his or her self-respect.</p>\n\n<p>Let me once again call the attention of the Congress to two subjects\nconcerning which I have frequently before communicated with them. One\nis the question of developing American shipping. I trust that a law\nembodying in substance the views, or a major part of the views, exprest\nin the report on this subject laid before the House at its last session\nwill be past. I am well aware that in former years objectionable\nmeasures have been proposed in reference to the encouragement of\nAmerican shipping; but it seems to me that the proposed measure is as\nnearly unobjectionable as any can be. It will of course benefit\nprimarily our seaboard States, such as Maine, Louisiana, and\nWashington; but what benefits part of our people in the end benefits\nall; just as Government aid to irrigation and forestry in the West is\nreally of benefit, not only to the Rocky Mountain States, but to all\nour country. If it prove impracticable to enact a law for the\nencouragement of shipping generally, then at least provision should be\nmade for better communication with South America, notably for fast mail\nlines to the chief South American ports. It is discreditable to us that\nour business people, for lack of direct communication in the shape of\nlines of steamers with South America, should in that great sister\ncontinent be at a disadvantage compared to the business people of\nEurope.</p>\n\n<p>I especially call your attention to the second subject, the condition\nof our currency laws. The national bank act has ably served a great\npurpose in aiding the enormous business development of the country; and\nwithin ten years there has been an increase in circulation per capita\nfrom $21.41 to $33.08. For several years evidence has been accumulating\nthat additional legislation is needed. The recurrence of each crop\nseason emphasizes the defects of the present laws. There must soon be a\nrevision of them, because to leave them as they are means to incur\nliability of business disaster. Since your body adjourned there has\nbeen a fluctuation in the interest on call money from 2 per cent to 30\nper cent; and the fluctuation was even greater during the preceding six\nmonths. The Secretary of the Treasury had to step in and by wise action\nput a stop to the most violent period of oscillation. Even worse than\nsuch fluctuation is the advance in commercial rates and the uncertainty\nfelt in the sufficiency of credit even at high rates. All commercial\ninterests suffer during each crop period. Excessive rates for call\nmoney in New York attract money from the interior banks into the\nspeculative field; this depletes the fund that would otherwise be\navailable for commercial uses, and commercial borrowers are forced to\npay abnormal rates; so that each fall a tax, in the shape of increased\ninterest charges, is placed on the whole commerce of the country.</p>\n\n<p>The mere statement of these has shows that our present system is\nseriously defective. There is need of a change. Unfortunately, however,\nmany of the proposed changes must be ruled from consideration because\nthey are complicated, are not easy of comprehension, and tend to,\ndisturb existing rights and interests. We must also rule out any plan\nwhich would materially impair the value of the United States 2 per cent\nbonds now pledged to secure circulations, the issue of which was made\nunder conditions peculiarly creditable to the Treasury. I do not press\nany especial plan. Various plans have recently been proposed by expert\ncommittees of bankers. Among the plans which are possibly feasible and\nwhich certainly should receive your consideration is that repeatedly\nbrought to your attention by the present Secretary of the Treasury, the\nessential features of which have been approved by many prominent\nbankers and business men. According to this plan national banks should\nbe permitted to issue a specified proportion of their capital in notes\nof a given kind, the issue to be taxed at so high a rate as to drive\nthe notes back when not wanted in legitimate trade. This plan would not\npermit the issue of currency to give banks additional profits, but to\nmeet the emergency presented by times of stringency.</p>\n\n<p>I do not say that this is the right system. I only advance it to\nemphasize my belief that there is need for the adoption of some system\nwhich shall be automatic and open to all sound banks, so as to avoid\nall possibility of discrimination and favoritism. Such a plan would\ntend to prevent the spasms of high money and speculation which now\nobtain in the New York market; for at present there is too much\ncurrency at certain seasons of the year, and its accumulation at New\nYork tempts bankers to lend it at low rates for speculative purposes;\nwhereas at other times when the crops are being moved there is urgent\nneed for a large but temporary increase in the currency supply. It must\nnever be forgotten that this question concerns business men generally\nquite as much as bankers; especially is this true of stockmen, farmers,\nand business men in the West; for at present at certain seasons of the\nyear the difference in interest rates between the East and the West is\nfrom 6 to 10 per cent, whereas in Canada the corresponding difference\nis but 2 per cent. Any plan must, of course, guard the interests of\nwestern and southern bankers as carefully as it guards the interests of\nNew York or Chicago bankers; and must be drawn from the standpoints of\nthe farmer and the merchant no less than from the standpoints of the\ncity banker and the country banker.</p>\n\n<p>The law should be amended so as specifically to provide that the funds\nderived from customs duties may be treated by the Secretary of the\nTreasury as he treats funds obtained under the internal-revenue laws.\nThere should be a considerable increase in bills of small\ndenominations. Permission should be given banks, if necessary under\nsettled restrictions, to retire their circulation to a larger amount\nthan three millions a month.</p>\n\n<p>I most earnestly hope that the bill to provide a lower tariff for or\nelse absolute free trade in Philippine products will become a law. No\nharm will come to any American industry; and while there will be some\nsmall but real material benefit to the Filipinos, the main benefit will\ncome by the showing made as to our purpose to do all in our power for\ntheir welfare. So far our action in the Philippines has been abundantly\njustified, not mainly and indeed not primarily because of the added\ndignity it has given us as a nation by proving that we are capable\nhonorably and efficiently to bear the international burdens which a\nmighty people should bear, but even more because of the immense benefit\nthat has come to the people of the Philippine Islands. In these islands\nwe are steadily introducing both liberty and order, to a greater degree\nthan their people have ever before known. We have secured justice. We\nhave provided an efficient police force, and have put down ladronism.\nOnly in the islands of Leyte and Samar is the authority of our\nGovernment resisted and this by wild mountain tribes under the\nsuperstitious inspiration of fakirs and pseudo-religions leaders. We\nare constantly increasing the measure of liberty accorded the\nislanders, and next spring, if conditions warrant, we shall take a\ngreat stride forward in testing their capacity for self-government by\nsummoning the first Filipino legislative assembly; and the way in which\nthey stand this test will largely determine whether the self-government\nthus granted will be increased or decreased; for if we have erred at\nall in the Philippines it has been in proceeding too rapidly in the\ndirection of granting a large measure of self-government. We are\nbuilding roads. We have, for the immeasurable good of the people,\narranged for the building of railroads. Let us also see to it that they\nare given free access to our markets. This nation owes no more\nimperative duty to itself and mankind than the duty of managing the\naffairs of all the islands under the American flag--the Philippines,\nPorto Rico, and Hawaii--so as to make it evident that it is in every\nway to their advantage that the flag should fly over them.</p>\n\n<p>American citizenship should be conferred on the citizens of Porto Rico.\nThe harbor of San Juan in Porto Rico should be dredged and improved.\nThe expenses of the federal court of Porto Rico should be met from the\nFederal Treasury. The administration of the affairs of Porto Rico,\ntogether with those of the Philippines, Hawaii, and our other insular\npossessions, should all be directed under one executive department; by\npreference the Department of State or the Department of War.</p>\n\n<p>The needs of Hawaii are peculiar; every aid should be given the\nislands; and our efforts should be unceasing to develop them along the\nlines of a community of small freeholders, not of great planters with\ncoolie-tilled estates. Situated as this Territory is, in the middle of\nthe Pacific, there are duties imposed upon this small community which\ndo not fall in like degree or manner upon any other American community.\nThis warrants our treating it differently from the way in which we\ntreat Territories contiguous to or surrounded by sister Territories or\nother States, and justifies the setting aside of a portion of our\nrevenues to be expended for educational and internal improvements\ntherein. Hawaii is now making an effort to secure immigration fit in\nthe end to assume the duties and burdens of full American citizenship,\nand whenever the leaders in the various industries of those islands\nfinally adopt our ideals and heartily join our administration in\nendeavoring to develop a middle class of substantial citizens, a way\nwill then be found to deal with the commercial and industrial problems\nwhich now appear to them so serious. The best Americanism is that which\naims for stability and permanency of prosperous citizenship, rather\nthan immediate returns on large masses of capital.</p>\n\n<p>Alaska\'s needs have been partially met, but there must be a complete\nreorganization of the governmental system, as I have before indicated\nto you. I ask your especial attention to this. Our fellow-citizens who\ndwell on the shores of Puget Sound with characteristic energy are\narranging to hold in Seattle the Alaska Yukon Pacific Exposition. Its\nspecial aims include the upbuilding of Alaska and the development of\nAmerican commerce on the Pacific Ocean. This exposition, in its\npurposes and scope, should appeal not only to the people of the Pacific\nslope, but to the people of the United States at large. Alaska since it\nwas bought has yielded to the Government eleven millions of dollars of\nrevenue, and has produced nearly three hundred millions of dollars in\ngold, furs, and fish. When properly developed it will become in large\ndegree a land of homes. The countries bordering the Pacific Ocean have\na population more numerous than that of all the countries of Europe;\ntheir annual foreign commerce amounts to over three billions of\ndollars, of which the share of the United States is some seven hundred\nmillions of dollars. If this trade were thoroughly understood and\npushed by our manufacturers and producers, the industries not only of\nthe Pacific slope, but of all our country, and particularly of our\ncotton-growing States, would be greatly benefited. Of course, in order\nto get these benefits, we must treat fairly the countries with which we\ntrade.</p>\n\n<p>It is a mistake, and it betrays a spirit of foolish cynicism, to\nmaintain that all international governmental action is, and must ever\nbe, based upon mere selfishness, and that to advance ethical reasons\nfor such action is always a sign of hypocrisy. This is no more\nnecessarily true of the action of governments than of the action of\nindividuals. It is a sure sign of a base nature always to ascribe base\nmotives for the actions of others. Unquestionably no nation can afford\nto disregard proper considerations of self-interest, any more than a\nprivate individual can so do. But it is equally true that the average\nprivate individual in any really decent community does many actions\nwith reference to other men in which he is guided, not by\nself-interest, but by public spirit, by regard for the rights of\nothers, by a disinterested purpose to do good to others, and to raise\nthe tone of the community as a whole. Similarly, a really great nation\nmust often act, and as a matter of fact often does act, toward other\nnations in a spirit not in the least of mere self-interest, but paying\nheed chiefly to ethical reasons; and as the centuries go by this\ndisinterestedness in international action, this tendency of the\nindividuals comprising a nation to require that nation to act with\njustice toward its neighbors, steadily grows and strengthens. It is\nneither wise nor right for a nation to disregard its own needs, and it\nis foolish--and may be wicked--to think that other nations will\ndisregard theirs. But it is wicked for a nation only to regard its own\ninterest, and foolish to believe that such is the sole motive that\nactuates any other nation. It should be our steady aim to raise the\nethical standard of national action just as we strive to raise the\nethical standard of individual action.</p>\n\n<p>Not only must we treat all nations fairly, but we must treat with\njustice and good will all immigrants who come here under the law.\nWhether they are Catholic or Protestant, Jew or Gentile; whether they\ncome from England or Germany, Russia, Japan, or Italy, matters nothing.\nAll we have a right to question is the man\'s conduct. If he is honest\nand upright in his dealings with his neighbor and with the State, then\nhe is entitled to respect and good treatment. Especially do we need to\nremember our duty to the stranger within our gates. It is the sure mark\nof a low civilization, a low morality, to abuse or discriminate against\nor in any way humiliate such stranger who has come here lawfully and\nwho is conducting himself properly. To remember this is incumbent on\nevery American citizen, and it is of course peculiarly incumbent on\nevery Government official, whether of the nation or of the several\nStates.</p>\n\n<p>I am prompted to say this by the attitude of hostility here and there\nassumed toward the Japanese in this country. This hostility is sporadic\nand is limited to a very few places. Nevertheless, it is most\ndiscreditable to us as a people, and it may be fraught with the gravest\nconsequences to the nation. The friendship between the United States\nand Japan has been continuous since the time, over half a century ago,\nwhen Commodore Perry, by his expedition to Japan, first opened the\nislands to western civilization. Since then the growth of Japan has\nbeen literally astounding. There is not only nothing to parallel it,\nbut nothing to approach it in the history of civilized mankind. Japan\nhas a glorious and ancient past. Her civilization is older than that of\nthe nations of northern Europe--the nations from whom the people of the\nUnited States have chiefly sprung. But fifty years ago Japan\'s\ndevelopment was still that of the Middle Ages. During that fifty years\nthe progress of the country in every walk in life has been a marvel to\nmankind, and she now stands as one of the greatest of civilized\nnations; great in the arts of war and in the arts of peace; great in\nmilitary, in industrial, in artistic development and achievement.\nJapanese soldiers and sailors have shown themselves equal in combat to\nany of whom history makes note. She has produced great generals and\nmighty admirals; her fighting men, afloat and ashore, show all the\nheroic courage, the unquestioning, unfaltering loyalty, the splendid\nindifference to hardship and death, which marked the Loyal Ronins; and\nthey show also that they possess the highest ideal of patriotism.\nJapanese artists of every kind see their products eagerly sought for in\nall lands. The industrial and commercial development of Japan has been\nphenomenal; greater than that of any other country during the same\nperiod. At the same time the advance in science and philosophy is no\nless marked. The admirable management of the Japanese Red Cross during\nthe late war, the efficiency and humanity of the Japanese officials,\nnurses, and doctors, won the respectful admiration of all acquainted\nwith the facts. Through the Red Cross the Japanese people sent over\n$100,000 to the sufferers of San Francisco, and the gift was accepted\nwith gratitude by our people. The courtesy of the Japanese, nationally\nand individually, has become proverbial. To no other country has there\nbeen such an increasing number of visitors from this land as to Japan.\nIn return, Japanese have come here in great numbers. They are welcome,\nsocially and intellectually, in all our colleges and institutions of\nhigher learning, in all our professional and social bodies. The\nJapanese have won in a single generation the right to stand abreast of\nthe foremost and most enlightened peoples of Europe and America; they\nhave won on their own merits and by their own exertions the right to\ntreatment on a basis of full and frank equality. The overwhelming mass\nof our people cherish a lively regard and respect for the people of\nJapan, and in almost every quarter of the Union the stranger from Japan\nis treated as he deserves; that is, he is treated as the stranger from\nany part of civilized Europe is and deserves to be treated. But here\nand there a most unworthy feeling has manifested itself toward the\nJapanese--the feeling that has been shown in shutting them out from the\ncommon schools in San Francisco, and in mutterings against them in one\nor two other places, because of their efficiency as workers. To shut\nthem out from the public schools is a wicked absurdity, when there are\nno first-class colleges in the land, including the universities and\ncolleges of California, which do not gladly welcome Japanese students\nand on which Japanese students do not reflect credit. We have as much\nto learn from Japan as Japan has to learn from us; and no nation is fit\nto teach unless it is also willing to learn. Throughout Japan Americans\nare well treated, and any failure on the part of Americans at home to\ntreat the Japanese with a like courtesy and consideration is by just so\nmuch a confession of inferiority in our civilization.</p>\n\n<p>Our nation fronts on the Pacific, just as it fronts on the Atlantic. We\nhope to play a constantly growing part in the great ocean of the\nOrient. We wish, as we ought to wish, for a great commercial\ndevelopment in our dealings with Asia; and it is out of the question\nthat we should permanently have such development unless we freely and\ngladly extend to other nations the same measure of justice and good\ntreatment which we expect to receive in return. It is only a very small\nbody of our citizens that act badly. Where the Federal Government has\npower it will deal summarily with any such. Where the several States\nhave power I earnestly ask that they also deal wisely and promptly with\nsuch conduct, or else this small body of wrongdoers may bring shame\nupon the great mass of their innocent and right-thinking fellows--that\nis, upon our nation as a whole. Good manners should be an international\nno less than an individual attribute. I ask fair treatment for the\nJapanese as I would ask fair treatment for Germans or Englishmen,\nFrenchmen, Russians, or Italians. I ask it as due to humanity and\ncivilization. I ask it as due to ourselves because we must act\nuprightly toward all men.</p>\n\n<p>I recommend to the Congress that an act be past specifically providing\nfor the naturalization of Japanese who come here intending to become\nAmerican citizens. One of the great embarrassments attending the\nperformance of our international obligations is the fact that the\nStatutes of the United States are entirely inadequate. They fail to\ngive to the National Government sufficiently ample power, through\nUnited States courts and by the use of the Army and Navy, to protect\naliens in the rights secured to them under solemn treaties which are\nthe law of the land. I therefore earnestly recommend that the criminal\nand civil statutes of the United States be so amended and added to as\nto enable the President, acting for the United States Government, which\nis responsible in our international relations, to enforce the rights of\naliens under treaties. Even as the law now is something can be done by\nthe Federal Government toward this end, and in the matter now before me\naffecting the Japanese everything that it is in my power to do will be\ndone, and all of the forces, military and civil, of the United States\nwhich I may lawfully employ will be so employed. There should, however,\nbe no particle of doubt as to the power of the National Government\ncompletely to perform and enforce its own obligations to other nations.\nThe mob of a single city may at any time perform acts of lawless\nviolence against some class of foreigners which would plunge us into\nwar. That city by itself would be powerless to make defense against the\nforeign power thus assaulted, and if independent of this Government it\nwould never venture to perform or permit the performance of the acts\ncomplained of. The entire power and the whole duty to protect the\noffending city or the offending community lies in the hands of the\nUnited States Government. It is unthinkable that we should continue a\npolicy under which a given locality may be allowed to commit a crime\nagainst a friendly nation, and the United States Government limited,\nnot to preventing the commission of the crime, but, in the last resort,\nto defending the people who have committed it against the consequences\nof their own wrongdoing.</p>\n\n<p>Last August an insurrection broke out in Cuba which it speedily grew\nevident that the existing Cuban Government was powerless to quell. This\nGovernment was repeatedly asked by the then Cuban Government to\nintervene, and finally was notified by the President of Cuba that he\nintended to resign; that his decision was irrevocable; that none of the\nother constitutional officers would consent to carry on the Government,\nand that he was powerless to maintain order. It was evident that chaos\nwas impending, and there was every probability that if steps were not\nimmediately taken by this Government to try to restore order the\nrepresentatives of various European nations in the island would apply\nto their respective governments for armed intervention in order to\nprotect the lives and property of their citizens. Thanks to the\npreparedness of our Navy, I was able immediately to send enough ships\nto Cuba to prevent the situation from becoming hopeless; and I\nfurthermore dispatched to Cuba the Secretary of War and the Assistant\nSecretary of State, in order that they might grapple with the situation\non the ground. All efforts to secure an agreement between the\ncontending factions, by which they should themselves come to an\namicable understanding and settle upon some modus vivendi--some\nprovisional government of their own--failed. Finally the President of\nthe Republic resigned. The quorum of Congress assembled failed by\ndeliberate purpose of its members, so that there was no power to act on\nhis resignation, and the Government came to a halt. In accordance with\nthe so-called Platt amendment, which was embodied in the constitution\nof Cuba, I thereupon proclaimed a provisional government for the\nisland, the Secretary of War acting as provisional governor until he\ncould be replaced by Mr. Magoon, the late minister to Panama and\ngovernor of the Canal Zone on the Isthmus; troops were sent to support\nthem and to relieve the Navy, the expedition being handled with most\nsatisfactory speed and efficiency. The insurgent chiefs immediately\nagreed that their troops should lay down their arms and disband; and\nthe agreement was carried out. The provisional government has left the\npersonnel of the old government and the old laws, so far as might be,\nunchanged, and will thus administer the island for a few months until\ntranquillity can be restored, a new election properly held, and a new\ngovernment inaugurated. Peace has come in the island; and the\nharvesting of the sugar-cane crop, the great crop of the island, is\nabout to proceed.</p>\n\n<p>When the election has been held and the new government inaugurated in\npeaceful and orderly fashion the provisional government will come to an\nend. I take this opportunity of expressing upon behalf of the American\npeople, with all possible solemnity, our most earnest hope that the\npeople of Cuba will realize the imperative need of preserving justice\nand keeping order in the Island. The United States wishes nothing of\nCuba except that it shall prosper morally and materially, and wishes\nnothing of the Cubans save that they shall be able to preserve order\namong themselves and therefore to preserve their independence. If the\nelections become a farce, and if the insurrectionary habit becomes\nconfirmed in the Island, it is absolutely out of the question that the\nIsland should continue independent; and the United States, which has\nassumed the sponsorship before the civilized world for Cuba\'s career as\na nation, would again have to intervene and to see that the government\nwas managed in such orderly fashion as to secure the safety of life and\nproperty. The path to be trodden by those who exercise self-government\nis always hard, and we should have every charity and patience with the\nCubans as they tread this difficult path. I have the utmost sympathy\nwith, and regard for, them; but I most earnestly adjure them solemnly\nto weigh their responsibilities and to see that when their new\ngovernment is started it shall run smoothly, and with freedom from\nflagrant denial of right on the one hand, and from insurrectionary\ndisturbances on the other.</p>\n\n<p>The Second International Conference of American Republics, held in\nMexico in the years 1901-2, provided for the holding of the third\nconference within five years, and committed the fixing of the time and\nplace and the arrangements for the conference to the governing board of\nthe Bureau of American Republics, composed of the representatives of\nall the American nations in Washington. That board discharged the duty\nimposed upon it with marked fidelity and painstaking care, and upon the\ncourteous invitation of the United States of Brazil the conference was\nheld at Rio de Janeiro, continuing from the 23d of July to the 29th of\nAugust last. Many subjects of common interest to all the American\nnations were discust by the conference, and the conclusions reached,\nembodied in a series of resolutions and proposed conventions, will be\nlaid before you upon the coming in of the final report of the American\ndelegates. They contain many matters of importance relating to the\nextension of trade, the increase of communication, the smoothing away\nof barriers to free intercourse, and the promotion of a better\nknowledge and good understanding between the different countries\nrepresented. The meetings of the conference were harmonious and the\nconclusions were reached with substantial unanimity. It is interesting\nto observe that in the successive conferences which have been held the\nrepresentatives of the different American nations have been learning to\nwork together effectively, for, while the First Conference in\nWashington in 1889, and the Second Conference in Mexico in 1901-2,\noccupied many months, with much time wasted in an unregulated and\nfruitless discussion, the Third Conference at Rio exhibited much of the\nfacility in the practical dispatch of business which characterizes\npermanent deliberative bodies, and completed its labors within the\nperiod of six weeks originally allotted for its sessions.</p>\n\n<p>Quite apart from the specific value of the conclusions reached by the\nconference, the example of the representatives of all the American\nnations engaging in harmonious and kindly consideration and discussion\nof subjects of common interest is itself of great and substantial value\nfor the promotion of reasonable and considerate treatment of all\ninternational questions. The thanks of this country are due to the\nGovernment of Brazil and to the people of Rio de Janeiro for the\ngenerous hospitality with which our delegates, in common with the\nothers, were received, entertained, and facilitated in their work.</p>\n\n<p>Incidentally to the meeting of the conference, the Secretary of State\nvisited the city of Rio de Janeiro and was cordially received by the\nconference, of which he was made an honorary president. The\nannouncement of his intention to make this visit was followed by most\ncourteous and urgent invitations from nearly all the countries of South\nAmerica to visit them as the guest of their Governments. It was deemed\nthat by the acceptance of these invitations we might appropriately\nexpress the real respect and friendship in which we hold our sister\nRepublics of the southern continent, and the Secretary, accordingly,\nvisited Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Panama, and Colombia.\nHe refrained from visiting Paraguay, Bolivia, and Ecuador only because\nthe distance of their capitals from the seaboard made it impracticable\nwith the time at his disposal. He carried with him a message of peace\nand friendship, and of strong desire for good understanding and mutual\nhelpfulness; and he was everywhere received in the spirit of his\nmessage. The members of government, the press, the learned professions,\nthe men of business, and the great masses of the people united\neverywhere in emphatic response to his friendly expressions and in\ndoing honor to the country and cause which he represented.</p>\n\n<p>In many parts of South America there has been much misunderstanding of\nthe attitude and purposes of the United States towards the other\nAmerican Republics. An idea had become prevalent that our assertion of\nthe Monroe Doctrine implied, or carried with it, an assumption of\nsuperiority, and of a right to exercise some kind of protectorate over\nthe countries to whose territory that doctrine applies. Nothing could\nbe farther from the truth. Yet that impression continued to be a\nserious barrier to good understanding, to friendly intercourse, to the\nintroduction of American capital and the extension of American trade.\nThe impression was so widespread that apparently it could not be\nreached by any ordinary means.</p>\n\n<p>It was part of Secretary Root\'s mission to dispel this unfounded\nimpression, and there is just cause to believe that he has succeeded.\nIn an address to the Third Conference at Rio on the 31st of July--an\naddress of such note that I send it in, together with this message--he\nsaid:</p>\n\n<p>"We wish for no victories but those of peace; for no territory except\nour own; for no sovereignty except the sovereignty over ourselves. We\ndeem the independence and equal rights of the smallest and weakest\nmember of the family of nations entitled to as much respect as those of\nthe greatest empire, and we deem the observance of that respect the\nchief guaranty of the weak against the oppression of the strong. We\nneither claim nor desire any rights or privileges or powers that we do\nnot freely concede to every American Republic. We wish to increase our\nprosperity, to extend our trade, to grow in wealth, in wisdom, and in\nspirit, but our conception of the true way to accomplish this is not to\npull down others and profit by their ruin, but to help all friends to a\ncommon prosperity and a common growth, that we may all become greater\nand stronger together. Within a few months for the first time the\nrecognized possessors of every foot of soil upon the American\ncontinents can be and I hope will be represented with the acknowledged\nrights of equal sovereign states in the great World Congress at The\nHague. This will be the world\'s formal and final acceptance of the\ndeclaration that no part of the American continents is to be deemed\nsubject to colonization. Let us pledge ourselves to aid each other in\nthe full performance of the duty to humanity which that accepted\ndeclaration implies, so that in time the weakest and most unfortunate\nof our Republics may come to march with equal step by the side of the\nstronger and more fortunate. Let us help each other to show that for\nall the races of men the liberty for which we have fought and labored\nis the twin sister of justice and peace. Let us unite in creating and\nmaintaining and making effective an all-American public opinion, whose\npower shall influence international conduct and prevent international\nwrong, and narrow the causes of war, and forever preserve our free\nlands from the burden of such armaments as are massed behind the\nfrontiers of Europe, and bring us ever nearer to the perfection of\nordered liberty. So shall come security and prosperity, production and\ntrade, wealth, learning, the arts, and happiness for us all."</p>\n\n<p>These words appear to have been received with acclaim in every part of\nSouth America. They have my hearty approval, as I am sure they will\nhave yours, and I can not be wrong in the conviction that they\ncorrectly represent the sentiments of the whole American people. I can\nnot better characterize the true attitude of the United States in its\nassertion of the Monroe Doctrine than in the words of the distinguished\nformer minister of foreign affairs of Argentina, Doctor Drago, in his\nspeech welcoming Mr. Root at Buenos Ayres. He spoke of--</p>\n\n<p>"The traditional policy of the United States (which) without\naccentuating superiority or seeking preponderance, condemned the\noppression of the nations of this part of the world and the control of\ntheir destinies by the great Powers of Europe."</p>\n\n<p>It is gratifying to know that in the great city of Buenos Ayres, upon\nthe arches which spanned the streets, entwined with Argentine and\nAmerican flags for the reception of our representative, there were\nemblazoned not\' only the names of Washington and Jefferson and\nMarshall, but also, in appreciative recognition of their services to\nthe cause of South American independence, the names of James Monroe,\nJohn Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, and Richard Rush. We take especial\npleasure in the graceful courtesy of the Government of Brazil, which \nhas given to the beautiful and stately building first used for the\nmeeting of the conference the name of "Palacio Monroe." Our grateful\nacknowledgments are due to the Governments and the people of all the\ncountries visited by the Secretary of State for the courtesy, the\nfriendship, and the honor shown to our country in their generous\nhospitality to him.</p>\n\n<p>In my message to you on the 5th of December, 1905, I called your\nattention to the embarrassment that might be caused to this Government\nby the assertion by foreign nations of the right to collect by force of\narms contract debts due by American republics to citizens of the\ncollecting nation, and to the danger that the process of compulsory\ncollection might result in the occupation of territory tending to\nbecome permanent. I then said:</p>\n\n<p>"Our own Government has always refused to enforce such contractual\nobligations on behalf of its citizens by an appeal to arms. It is much\nto be wisht that all foreign governments would take the same view."</p>\n\n<p>This subject was one of the topics of consideration at the conference\nat Rio and a resolution was adopted by that conference recommending to\nthe respective governments represented "to consider the advisability of\nasking the Second Peace Conference at The Hague to examine the question\nof the compulsory collection of public debts, and, in general, means\ntending to diminish among nations conflicts of purely pecuniary\norigin."</p>\n\n<p>This resolution was supported by the representatives of the United\nStates in accordance with the following instructions:</p>\n\n<p>"It has long been the established policy of the United States not to\nuse its armed forces for the collection of ordinary contract debts due\nto its citizens by other governments. We have not considered the use of\nforce for such a purpose consistent with that respect for the\nindependent sovereignty of other members of the family of nations which\nis the most important principle of international law and the chief\nprotection of weak nations against the oppression of the strong. It\nseems to us that the practise is injurious in its general effect upon\nthe relations of nations and upon the welfare of weak and disordered\nstates, whose development ought to be encouraged in the interests of\ncivilization; that it offers frequent temptation to bullying and\noppression and to unnecessary and unjustifiable warfare. We regret that\nother powers, whose opinions and sense of justice we esteem highly,\nhave at times taken a different view and have permitted themselves,\nthough we believe with reluctance, to collect such debts by force. It\nis doubtless true that the non-payment of public debts may be\naccompanied by such circumstances of fraud and wrongdoing or violation\nof treaties as to justify the use of force. This Government would be\nglad to see an international consideration of the subject which shall\ndiscriminate between such cases and the simple nonperformance of a\ncontract with a private person, and a resolution in favor of reliance\nupon peaceful means in cases of the latter class.</p>\n\n<p>"It is not felt, however, that the conference at Rio should undertake\nto make such a discrimination or to resolve upon such a rule. Most of\nthe American countries are still debtor nations, while the countries of\nEurope are the creditors. If the Rio conference, therefore, were to\ntake such action it would have the appearance of a meeting of debtors\nresolving how their creditors should act, and this would not inspire\nrespect. The true course is indicated by the terms of the program,\nwhich proposes to request the Second Hague Conference, where both\ncreditors and debtors will be assembled, to consider the subject."</p>\n\n<p>Last June trouble which had existed for some time between the Republics\nof Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras culminated in war--a war which\nthreatened to be ruinous to the countries involved and very destructive\nto the commercial interests of Americans, Mexicans, and other\nforeigners who are taking an important part in the development of these\ncountries. The thoroughly good understanding which exists between the\nUnited States and Mexico enabled this Government and that of Mexico to\nunite in effective mediation between the warring Republics; which\nmediation resulted, not without long-continued and patient effort, in\nbringing about a meeting of the representatives of the hostile powers\non board a United States warship as neutral territory, and peace was\nthere concluded; a peace which resulted in the saving of thousands of\nlives and in the prevention of an incalculable amount of misery and the\ndestruction of property and of the means of livelihood. The Rio\nConference past the following resolution in reference to this action:</p>\n\n<p>"That the Third International American Conference shall address to the\nPresidents of the United States of America and of the United States of\nMexico a note in which the conference which is being held at Rio\nexpresses its satisfaction at the happy results of their mediation for\nthe celebration of peace between the Republics of Guatemala, Honduras,\nand Salvador."</p>\n\n<p>This affords an excellent example of one way in which the influence of\nthe United States can properly be exercised for the benefit of the\npeoples of the Western Hemisphere; that is, by action taken in concert\nwith other American republics and therefore free from those suspicions\nand prejudices which might attach if the action were taken by one\nalone. In this way it is possible to exercise a powerful influence\ntoward the substitution of considerate action in the spirit of justice\nfor the insurrectionary or international violence which has hitherto\nbeen so great a hindrance to the development of many of our neighbors.\nRepeated examples of united action by several or many American\nrepublics in favor of peace, by urging cool and reasonable, instead of\nexcited and belligerent, treatment of international controversies, can\nnot fail to promote the growth of a general public opinion among the\nAmerican nations which will elevate the standards of international\naction, strengthen the sense of international duty among governments,\nand tell in favor of the peace of mankind.</p>\n\n<p>I have just returned from a trip to Panama and shall report to you at\nlength later on the whole subject of the Panama Canal.</p>\n\n<p>The Algeciras Convention, which was signed by the United States as well\nas by most of the powers of Europe, supersedes the previous convention\nof 1880, which was also signed both by the United States and a majority\nof the European powers. This treaty confers upon us equal commercial\nrights with all European countries and does not entail a single\nobligation of any kind upon us, and I earnestly hope it may be speedily\nratified. To refuse to ratify it would merely mean that we forfeited\nour commercial rights in Morocco and would not achieve another object\nof any kind. In the event of such refusal we would be left for the\nfirst time in a hundred and twenty years without any commercial treaty\nwith Morocco; and this at a time when we are everywhere seeking new\nmarkets and outlets for trade.</p>\n\n<p>The destruction of the Pribilof Islands fur seals by pelagic sealing\nstill continues. The herd which, according to the surveys made in 1874\nby direction of the Congress, numbered 4,700,000, and which, according\nto the survey of both American and Canadian commissioners in 1891,\namounted to 1,000,000, has now been reduced to about 180,000. This\nresult has been brought about by Canadian and some other sealing\nvessels killing the female seals while in the water during their annual\npilgrimage to and from the south, or in search of food. As a rule the\nfemale seal when killed is pregnant, and also has an unweaned pup on\nland, so that, for each skin taken by pelagic sealing, as a rule, three\nlives are destroyed--the mother, the unborn offspring, and the nursing\npup, which is left to starve to death. No damage whatever is done to\nthe herd by the carefully regulated killing on land; the custom of\npelagic sealing is solely responsible for all of the present evil, and\nis alike indefensible from the economic standpoint and from the\nstandpoint of humanity.</p>\n\n<p>In 1896 over 16,000 young seals were found dead from starvation on the\nPribilof Islands. In 1897 it was estimated that since pelagic sealing\nbegan upward of 400,000 adult female seals had been killed at sea, and\nover 300,000 young seals had died of starvation as the result. The\nrevolting barbarity of such a practise, as well as the wasteful\ndestruction which it involves, needs no demonstration and is its own\ncondemnation. The Bering Sea Tribunal, which sat in Paris in 1893, and\nwhich decided against the claims of the United States to exclusive\njurisdiction in the waters of Bering Sea and to a property right in the\nfur seals when outside of the three-mile limit, determined also upon\ncertain regulations which the Tribunal considered sufficient for the\nproper protection and preservation of the fur seal in, or habitually\nresorting to, the Bering Sea. The Tribunal by its regulations\nestablished a close season, from the 1st of May to the 31st of July,\nand excluded all killing in the waters within 60 miles around the\nPribilof Islands. They also provided that the regulations which they\nhad determined upon, with a view to the protection and preservation of\nthe seals, should be submitted every five years to new examination, so\nas to enable both interested Governments to consider whether, in the\nlight of past experience, there was occasion for any modification\nthereof.</p>\n\n<p>The regulations have proved plainly inadequate to accomplish the object\nof protection and preservation of the fur seals, and for a long time\nthis Government has been trying in vain to secure from Great Britain\nsuch revision and modification of the regulations as were contemplated\nand provided for by the award of the Tribunal of Paris.</p>\n\n<p>The process of destruction has been accelerated during recent years by\nthe appearance of a number of Japanese vessels engaged in pelagic\nsealing. As these vessels have not been bound even by the inadequate\nlimitations prescribed by the Tribunal of Paris, they have paid no\nattention either to the close season or to the sixty-mile limit imposed\nupon the Canadians, and have prosecuted their work up to the very\nislands themselves. On July 16 and 17 the crews from several Japanese\nvessels made raids upon the island of St. Paul, and before they were\nbeaten off by the very meager and insufficiently armed guard, they\nsucceeded in killing several hundred seals and carrying off the skins\nof most of them. Nearly all the seals killed were females and the work\nwas done with frightful barbarity. Many of the seals appear to have\nbeen skinned alive and many were found half skinned and still alive.\nThe raids were repelled only by the use of firearms, and five of the\nraiders were killed, two were wounded, and twelve captured, including\nthe two wounded. Those captured have since been tried and sentenced to\nimprisonment. An attack of this kind had been wholly unlookt for, but\nsuch provision of vessels, arms, and ammunition will now be made that\nits repetition will not be found profitable.</p>\n\n<p>Suitable representations regarding the incident have been made to the\nGovernment of Japan, and we are assured that all practicable measures\nwill be taken by that country to prevent any recurrence of the outrage.\nOn our part, the guard on the island will be increased and better\nequipped and organized, and a better revenue-cutter patrol service\nabout the islands will be established; next season a United States war\nvessel will also be sent there.</p>\n\n<p>We have not relaxed our efforts to secure an agreement with Great\nBritain for adequate protection of the seal herd, and negotiations with\nJapan for the same purpose are in progress.</p>\n\n<p>The laws for the protection of the seals within the jurisdiction of the\nUnited States need revision and amendment. Only the islands of St. Paul\nand St. George are now, in terms, included in the Government\nreservation, and the other islands are also to be included. The landing\nof aliens as well as citizens upon the islands, without a permit from\nthe Department of Commerce and Labor, for any purpose except in case of\nstress of weather or for water, should be prohibited under adequate\npenalties. The approach of vessels for the excepted purposes should be\nregulated. The authority of the Government agents on the islands should\nbe enlarged, and the chief agent should have the powers of a committing\nmagistrate. The entrance of a vessel into the territorial waters\nsurrounding the islands with intent to take seals should be made a\ncriminal offense and cause of forfeiture. Authority for seizures in\nsuch cases should be given and the presence on any such vessel of seals\nor sealskins, or the paraphernalia for taking them, should be made\nprima facie evidence of such intent. I recommend what legislation is\nneeded to accomplish these ends; and I commend to your attention the\nreport of Mr. Sims, of the Department of Commerce and Labor, on this\nsubject.</p>\n\n<p>In case we are compelled to abandon the hope of making arrangements\nwith other governments to put an end to the hideous cruelty now\nincident to pelagic sealing, it will be a question for your serious\nconsideration how far we should continue to protect and maintain the\nseal herd on land with the result of continuing such a practise, and\nwhether it is not better to end the practice by exterminating the herd\nourselves in the most humane way possible.</p>\n\n<p>In my last message I advised you that the Emperor of Russia had taken\nthe initiative in bringing about a second peace conference at The\nHague. Under the guidance of Russia the arrangement of the\npreliminaries for such a conference has been progressing during the\npast year. Progress has necessarily been slow, owing to the great\nnumber of countries to be consulted upon every question that has\narisen. It is a matter of satisfaction that all of the American\nRepublics have now, for the first time, been invited to join in the\nproposed conference.</p>\n\n<p>The close connection between the subjects to be taken up by the Red\nCross Conference held at Geneva last summer and the subjects which\nnaturally would come before The Hague Conference made it apparent that\nit was desirable to have the work of the Red Cross Conference completed\nand considered by the different powers before the meeting at The Hague.\nThe Red Cross Conference ended its labors on the 6th day of July, and\nthe revised and amended convention, which was signed by the American\ndelegates, will be promptly laid before the Senate.</p>\n\n<p>By the special and highly appreciated courtesy of the Governments of\nRussia and the Netherlands, a proposal to call The Hague Conference\ntogether at a time which would conflict with the Conference of the\nAmerican Republics at Rio de Janeiro in August was laid aside. No other\ndate has yet been suggested. A tentative program for the conference has\nbeen proposed by the Government of Russia, and the subjects which it\nenumerates are undergoing careful examination and consideration in\npreparation for the conference.</p>\n\n<p>It must ever be kept in mind that war is not merely justifiable, but\nimperative, upon honorable men, upon an honorable nation, where peace\ncan only be obtained by the sacrifice of conscientious conviction or of\nnational welfare. Peace is normally a great good, and normally it\ncoincides with righteousness; but it is righteousness and not peace\nwhich should bind the conscience of a nation as it should bind the\nconscience of an individual; and neither a nation nor an individual can\nsurrender conscience to another\'s keeping. Neither can a nation, which\nis an entity, and which does not die as individuals die, refrain from\ntaking thought for the interest of the generations that are to come, no\nless than for the interest of the generation of to-day; and no public\nmen have a right, whether from shortsightedness, from selfish\nindifference, or from sentimentality, to sacrifice national interests\nwhich are vital in character. A just war is in the long run far better\nfor a nation\'s soul than the most prosperous peace obtained by\nacquiescence in wrong or injustice. Moreover, though it is criminal for\na nation not to prepare for war, so that it may escape the dreadful\nconsequences of being defeated in war, yet it must always be remembered\nthat even to be defeated in war may be far better than not to have\nfought at all. As has been well and finely said, a beaten nation is not\nnecessarily a disgraced nation; but the nation or man is disgraced if\nthe obligation to defend right is shirked.</p>\n\n<p>We should as a nation do everything in our power for the cause of\nhonorable peace. It is morally as indefensible for a nation to commit a\nwrong upon another nation, strong or weak, as for an individual thus to\nwrong his fellows. We should do all in our power to hasten the day when\nthere shall be peace among the nations--a peace based upon justice and\nnot upon cowardly submission to wrong. We can accomplish a good deal in\nthis direction, but we can not accomplish everything, and the penalty\nof attempting to do too much would almost inevitably be to do worse\nthan nothing; for it must be remembered that fantastic extremists are\nnot in reality leaders of the causes which they espouse, but are\nordinarily those who do most to hamper the real leaders of the cause\nand to damage the cause itself. As yet there is no likelihood of\nestablishing any kind of international power, of whatever sort, which\ncan effectively check wrongdoing, and in these circumstances it would\nbe both a foolish and an evil thing for a great and free nation to\ndeprive itself of the power to protect its own rights and even in\nexceptional cases to stand up for the rights of others. Nothing would\nmore promote iniquity, nothing would further defer the reign upon earth\nof peace and righteousness, than for the free and enlightened peoples\nwhich, though with much stumbling and many shortcomings, nevertheless\nstrive toward justice, deliberately to render themselves powerless\nwhile leaving every despotism and barbarism armed and able to work\ntheir wicked will. The chance for the settlement of disputes\npeacefully, by arbitration, now depends mainly upon the possession by\nthe nations that mean to do right of sufficient armed strength to make\ntheir purpose effective.</p>\n\n<p>The United States Navy is the surest guarantor of peace which this\ncountry possesses. It is earnestly to be wisht that we would profit by\nthe teachings of history in this matter. A strong and wise people will\nstudy its own failures no less than its triumphs, for there is wisdom\nto be learned from the study of both, of the mistake as well as of the\nsuccess. For this purpose nothing could be more instructive than a\nrational study of the war of 1812, as it is told, for instance, by\nCaptain Mahan. There was only one way in which that war could have been\navoided. If during the preceding twelve years a navy relatively as\nstrong as that which this country now has had been built up, and an\narmy provided relatively as good as that which the country now has,\nthere never would have been the slightest necessity of fighting the\nwar; and if the necessity had arisen the war would under such\ncircumstances have ended with our speedy and overwhelming triumph. But\nour people during those twelve years refused to make any preparations\nwhatever, regarding either the Army or the Navy. They saved a million\nor two of dollars by so doing; and in mere money paid a hundredfold for\neach million they thus saved during the three years of war which\nfollowed--a war which brought untold suffering upon our people, which\nat one time threatened the gravest national disaster, and which, in\nspite of the necessity of waging it, resulted merely in what was in\neffect a drawn battle, while the balance of defeat and triumph was\nalmost even.</p>\n\n<p>I do not ask that we continue to increase our Navy. I ask merely that\nit be maintained at its present strength; and this can be done only if\nwe replace the obsolete and outworn ships by new and good ones, the\nequals of any afloat in any navy. To stop building ships for one year\nmeans that for that year the Navy goes back instead of forward. The old\nbattle ship Texas, for instance, would now be of little service in a\nstand-up fight with a powerful adversary. The old double-turret\nmonitors have outworn their usefulness, while it was a waste of money\nto build the modern single-turret monitors. All these ships should be\nreplaced by others; and this can be done by a well-settled program of\nproviding for the building each year of at least one first-class battle\nship equal in size and speed to any that any nation is at the same time\nbuilding; the armament presumably to consist of as large a number as\npossible of very heavy guns of one caliber, together with smaller guns\nto repel torpedo attack; while there should be heavy armor, turbine\nengines, and in short, every modern device. Of course, from time to\ntime, cruisers, colliers, torpedo-boat destroyers or torpedo boats,\nWill have to be built also. All this, be it remembered, would not\nincrease our Navy, but would merely keep it at its present strength.\nEqually of course, the ships will be absolutely useless if the men\naboard them are not so trained that they can get the best possible\nservice out of the formidable but delicate and complicated mechanisms\nintrusted to their care. The marksmanship of our men has so improved\nduring the last five years that I deem it within bounds to say that the\nNavy is more than twice as efficient, ship for ship, as half a decade\nago. The Navy can only attain proper efficiency if enough officers and\nmen are provided, and if these officers and men are given the chance\n(and required to take advantage of it) to stay continually at sea and\nto exercise the fleets singly and above all in squadron, the exercise\nto be of every kind and to include unceasing practise at the guns,\nconducted under conditions that will test marksmanship in time of war.</p>\n\n<p>In both the Army and the Navy there is urgent need that everything\npossible should be done to maintain the highest standard for the\npersonnel, alike as regards the officers and the enlisted men. I do not\nbelieve that in any service there is a finer body of enlisted men and\nof junior officer than we have in both the Army and the Navy, including\nthe Marine Corps. All possible encouragement to the enlisted men should\nbe given, in pay and otherwise, and everything practicable done to\nrender the service attractive to men of the right type. They should be\nheld to the strictest discharge of their duty, and in them a spirit\nshould be encouraged which demands not the mere performance of duty,\nbut the performance of far more than duty, if it conduces to the honor\nand the interest of the American nation; and in return the amplest\nconsideration should be theirs.</p>\n\n<p>West Point and Annapolis already turn out excellent officers. We do not\nneed to have these schools made more scholastic. On the contrary we\nshould never lose sight of the fact that the aim of each school is to\nturn out a man who shall be above everything else a fighting man. In\nthe Army in particular it is not necessary that either the cavalry or\ninfantry officer should have special mathematical ability. Probably in\nboth schools the best part of the education is the high standard of\ncharacter and of professional morale which it confers.</p>\n\n<p>But in both services there is urgent need for the establishment of a\nprinciple of selection which will eliminate men after a certain age if\nthey can not be promoted from the subordinate ranks, and which will\nbring into the higher ranks fewer men, and these at an earlier age.\nThis principle of selection will be objected to by good men of mediocre\ncapacity, who are fitted to do well while young in the lower positions,\nbut who are not fitted to do well when at an advanced age they come\ninto positions of command and of great responsibility. But the desire\nof these men to be promoted to positions which they are not competent\nto fill should not weigh against the interest of the Navy and the\ncountry. At present our men, especially in the Navy, are kept far too\nlong in the junior grades, and then, at much too advanced an age, are\nput quickly through the senior grades, often not attaining to these\nsenior grades until they are too old to be of real use in them; and if\nthey are of real use, being put through them so quickly that little\nbenefit to the Navy comes from their having been in them at all.</p>\n\n<p>The Navy has one great advantage over the Army in the fact that the\nofficers of high rank are actually trained in the continual performance\nof their duties; that is, in the management of the battle ships and\narmored cruisers gathered into fleets. This is not true of the army\nofficers, who rarely have corresponding chances to exercise command\nover troops under service conditions. The conduct of the Spanish war\nshowed the lamentable loss of life, the useless extravagance, and the\ninefficiency certain to result, if during peace the high officials of\nthe War and Navy Departments are praised and rewarded only if they save\nmoney at no matter what cost to the efficiency of the service, and if\nthe higher officers are given no chance whatever to exercise and\npractise command. For years prior to the Spanish war the Secretaries of\nWar were praised chiefly if they practised economy; which economy,\nespecially in connection with the quartermaster, commissary, and\nmedical departments, was directly responsible for most of the\nmismanagement that occurred in the war itself--and parenthetically be\nit observed that the very people who clamored for the misdirected\neconomy in the first place were foremost to denounce the mismanagement,\nloss, and suffering which were primarily due to this same misdirected\neconomy and to the lack of preparation it involved. There should soon\nbe an increase in the number of men for our coast defenses; these men\nshould be of the right type and properly trained; and there should\ntherefore be an increase of pay for certain skilled grades, especially\nin the coast artillery. Money should be appropriated to permit troops\nto be massed in body and exercised in maneuvers, particularly in\nmarching. Such exercise during the summer just past has been of\nincalculable benefit to the Army and should under no circumstances be\ndiscontinued. If on these practise marches and in these maneuvers\nelderly officers prove unable to bear the strain, they should be\nretired at once, for the fact is conclusive as to their unfitness for\nwar; that is, for the only purpose because of which they should be\nallowed to stay in the service. It is a real misfortune to have scores\nof small company or regimental posts scattered throughout the country;\nthe Army should be gathered in a few brigade or division posts; and the\ngenerals should be practised in handling the men in masses. Neglect to\nprovide for all of this means to incur the risk of future disaster and\ndisgrace.</p>\n\n<p>The readiness and efficiency of both the Army and Navy in dealing with\nthe recent sudden crisis in Cuba illustrate afresh their value to the\nNation. This readiness and efficiency would have been very much less\nhad it not been for the existence of the General Staff in the Army and\nthe General Board in the Navy; both are essential to the proper\ndevelopment and use of our military forces afloat and ashore. The\ntroops that were sent to Cuba were handled flawlessly. It was the\nswiftest mobilization and dispatch of troops over sea ever accomplished\nby our Government. The expedition landed completely equipped and ready\nfor immediate service, several of its organizations hardly remaining in\nHavana over night before splitting up into detachments and going to\ntheir several posts, It was a fine demonstration of the value and\nefficiency of the General Staff. Similarly, it was owing in large part\nto the General Board that the Navy was able at the outset to meet the\nCuban crisis with such instant efficiency; ship after ship appearing on\nthe shortest notice at any threatened point, while the Marine Corps in\nparticular performed indispensable service. The Army and Navy War\nColleges are of incalculable value to the two services, and they\ncooperate with constantly increasing efficiency and importance.</p>\n\n<p>The Congress has most wisely provided for a National Board for the\npromotion of rifle practise. Excellent results have already come from\nthis law, but it does not go far enough. Our Regular Army is so small\nthat in any great war we should have to trust mainly to volunteers; and\nin such event these volunteers should already know how to shoot; for if\na soldier has the fighting edge, and ability to take care of himself in\nthe open, his efficiency on the line of battle is almost directly\nProportionate to excellence in marksmanship. We should establish\nshooting galleries in all the large public and military schools, should\nmaintain national target ranges in different parts of the country, and\nshould in every way encourage the formation of rifle clubs throughout\nall parts of the land. The little Republic of Switzerland offers us an\nexcellent example in all matters connected with building up an\nefficient citizen soldiery.\n</p>\n\t\t\t<div class="textNav"><a href="#top">^ Return to top</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>\n\t<div id="footer"><strong><em>State of the Union</em></strong> is a project\n\t\tby Brad Borevitz at <a href="http://www.onetwothree.net">onetwothree.net</a></div>\n</div>\n<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">\n</script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n_uacct = "UA-410742-1";\nurchinTracker();\n</script>\n</body>\n<!-- InstanceEnd -->\n</html>\n'
