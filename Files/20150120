Fifteen years\nthat dawned with terror touching our shores, that unfolded with a new\ngeneration fighting two long and costly wars, that saw a vicious\nrecession spread across our Nation and the world. It has been and still\nis a hard time for many.</p>\n\n<p>But tonight we turn the page. Tonight, after a breakthrough year for\nAmerica, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace\nsince 1999. Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the\nfinancial crisis. More of our kids are graduating than ever before. More\nof our people are insured than ever before. And we are as free from the\ngrip of foreign oil as we\'ve been in almost 30 years.</p>\n\n<p>Tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in\nAfghanistan is over. Six years ago, nearly 180,000 American troops\nserved in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, fewer than 15,000 remain. And we\nsalute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11\ngeneration who has served to keep us safe. We are humbled and grateful\nfor your service.</p>\n\n<p>America, for all that we have endured, for all the grit and hard work\nrequired to come back, for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this: The\nshadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong.</p>\n\n<p>At this momentwith a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling\nindustry, booming energy productionwe have risen from recession freer to\nwrite our own future than any other nation on Earth. It\'s now up to us\nto choose who we want to be over the next 15 years and for decades to\ncome.</p>\n\n<p>Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well?\nOr will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes\nand chances for everyone who makes the effort?</p>\n\n<p>Will we approach the world fearful and reactive, dragged into costly\nconflicts that strain our military and set back our standing? Or will we\nlead wisely, using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and\nprotect our planet?</p>\n\n<p>Will we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against\none another? Or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has\nalways propelled America forward?</p>\n\n<p>In 2 weeks, I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas that\nare practical, not partisan. And in the months ahead, I\'ll crisscross\nthe country making a case for those ideas. So tonight I want to focus\nless on a checklist of proposals and focus more on the values at stake\nin the choices before us.</p>\n\n<p>It begins with our economy. Seven years ago, Rebekah and Ben Erler of\nMinneapolis were newlyweds. She waited tables. He worked construction.\nTheir first child Jack was on the way. They were young and in love in\nAmerica. And it doesn\'t get much better than that. "If only we had\nknown," Rebekah wrote to me last spring, "what was about to happen to\nthe housing and construction market." As the crisis worsened, Ben\'s\nbusiness dried up, so he took what jobs he could find, even if they kept\nhim on the road for long stretches of time. Rebekah took out student\nloans and enrolled in community college and retrained for a new career.\nThey sacrificed for each other. And slowly, it paid off. They bought\ntheir first home. They had a second son Henry. Rebekah got a better job\nand then a raise. Ben is back in construction and home for dinner every\nnight.</p>\n\n<p>"It is amazing," Rebekah wrote, "what you can bounce back from when you\nhave to. . . . We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it\nthrough some very, very hard times." We are a strong, tight-knit family\nwho has made it through some very, very hard times.</p>\n\n<p>America, Rebekah and Ben\'s story is our story. They represent the\nmillions who have worked hard and scrimped and sacrificed and retooled.\nYou are the reason that I ran for this office. You are the people I was\nthinking of 6 years ago today, in the darkest months of the crisis, when\nI stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild our\neconomy on a new foundation. And it has been your resilience, your\neffort that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger.</p>\n\n<p>We believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing and draw new jobs\nto our shores. And over the past 5 years, our businesses have created\nmore than 11 million new jobs.</p>\n\n<p>We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect\nour planet. And today, America is number one in oil and gas. America is\nnumber one in wind power. Every 3 weeks, we bring online as much solar\npower as we did in all of 2008. And thanks to lower gas prices and\nhigher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save about\n$750 at the pump.</p>\n\n<p>We believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world. And\ntoday, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading\nscores on record. Our high school graduation rate has hit an alltime\nhigh. More Americans finish college than ever before.</p>\n\n<p>We believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis,\nshield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition. Today, we\nhave new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts and a new consumer\nwatchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card\npractices. And in the past year alone, about 10 million uninsured\nAmericans finally gained the security of health coverage.</p>\n\n<p>At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious,\nthat we would crush jobs and explode deficits. Instead, we\'ve seen the\nfastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by\ntwo-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation\nat its lowest rate in 50 years. This is good news, people.</p>\n\n<p>So the verdict is clear. Middle class economics works. Expanding\nopportunity works. And these policies will continue to work as long as\npolitics don\'t get in the way. We can\'t slow down businesses or put our\neconomy at risk with Government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns. We can\'t\nput the security of families at risk by taking away their health\ninsurance or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street or refighting past\nbattles on immigration when we\'ve got to fix a broken system. And if a\nbill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, I will veto\nit. It will have earned my veto.</p>\n\n<p>Today, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and\nmore lives. Wages are finally starting to rise again. We know that more\nsmall-business owners plan to raise their employees\' pay than at any\ntime since 2007. But here\'s the thing: Those of us here tonight, we need\nto set our sights higher than just making sure Government doesn\'t screw\nthings up  that Government doesn\'t halt the progress we\'re making. We\nneed to do more than just do no harm. Tonight, together, let\'s do more\nto restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every\nAmerican.</p>\n\n<p>Because families like Rebekah\'s still need our help. She and Ben are\nworking as hard as ever, but they\'ve had to forego vacations and a new\ncar so that they can pay off student loans and save for retirement.\nFriday night pizza, that\'s a big splurge. Basic childcare for Jack and\nHenry costs more than their mortgage and almost as much as a year at the\nUniversity of Minnesota. Like millions of hard-working Americans,\nRebekah isn\'t asking for a handout, but she is asking that we look for\nmore ways to help families get ahead.</p>\n\n<p>And in fact, at every moment of economic change throughout our history,\nthis country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances and to\nmake sure everyone gets a fair shot. We set up worker protections,\nSocial Security, Medicare, Medicaid to protect ourselves from the\nharshest adversity. We gave our citizens schools and colleges,\ninfrastructure and the Internet, tools they needed to go as far as their\nefforts and their dreams will take them.</p>\n\n<p>That\'s what middle class economics is: the idea that this country does\nbest when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share,\neveryone plays by the same set of rules. We don\'t just want everyone to\nshare in America\'s success, we want everyone to contribute to our\nsuccess.</p>\n\n<p>So what does middle class economics require in our time? First, middle\nclass economics means helping working families feel more secure in a\nworld of constant change. That means helping folks afford childcare,\ncollege, health care, a home, retirement. And my budget will address\neach of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting\nthousands of dollars back into their pockets each year.</p>\n\n<p>Here\'s one example. During World War II, when men like my grandfather\nwent off to war, having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a\nnational security priority, so this country provided universal\nchildcare. In today\'s economy, when having both parents in the workforce\nis an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable,\nhigh-quality childcare more than ever.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s not a nice-to-have, it\'s a must-have. So it\'s time we stop treating\nchildcare as a side issue, or as a women\'s issue, and treat it like the\nnational economic priority that it is for all of us. And that\'s why my\nplan will make quality childcare more available and more affordable for\nevery middle class and low-income family with young children in America,\nby creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per\nyear.</p>\n\n<p>Here\'s another example. Today, we are the only advanced country on Earth\nthat doesn\'t guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our\nworkers. Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave43 million.\nThink about that. And that forces too many parents to make the\ngut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home. So I\'ll\nbe taking new action to help States adopt paid leave laws of their own.\nAnd since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November,\nlet\'s put it to a vote right here in Washington. Send me a bill that\ngives every worker in America the opportunity to earn 7 days of paid\nsick leave. It\'s the right thing to do. It\'s the right thing to do.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages.\nThat\'s why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a\nwoman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work. I mean, it\'s\n2015. It\'s time. We still need to make sure employees get the overtime\nthey\'ve earned. And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to\nraise the minimum wage, I say this: If you truly believe you could work\nfull time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, try it. If\nnot, vote to give millions of the hardest working people in America a\nraise.</p>\n\n<p>Now, these ideas won\'t make everybody rich, won\'t relieve every\nhardship. That\'s not the job of government. To give working families a\nfair shot, we still need more employers to see beyond next quarter\'s\nearnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their\ncompany\'s long-term interest. We still need laws that strengthen rather\nthan weaken unions, and give American workers a voice.</p>\n\n<p>But you know, things like childcare and sick leave and equal pay, things\nlike lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wagethese ideas will\nmake a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families.\nThat\'s a fact. And that\'s what all of us, Republicans and Democrats\nalike, were sent here to do.</p>\n\n<p>Now, second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road,\nwe have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills. America\nthrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a\ngeneration of GIs to college, trained the best workforce in the world.\nWe were ahead of the curve. But other countries caught on. And in a\n21st-century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need\nto up our game. We need to do more.</p>\n\n<p>By the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some\nhigher educationtwo in three. And yet we still live in a country where\ntoo many bright, striving Americans are priced out of the education they\nneed. It\'s not fair to them, and it\'s sure not smart for our future. And\nthat\'s why I\'m sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost\nof community college to zero.</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind, 40 percent of our college students choose community\ncollege. Some are young and starting out. Some are older and looking for\na better job. Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition\nback into the job market. Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to\ngraduate ready for the new economy without a load of debt. Understand,\nyou\'ve got to earn it. You\'ve got to keep your grades up and graduate on\ntime.</p>\n\n<p>Tennessee, a State with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with\nDemocratic leadership, are showing that free community college is\npossible. I want to spread that idea all across America so that 2 years\nof college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is\ntoday. Let\'s stay ahead of the curve. And I want to work with this\nCongress to make sure those already burdened with student loans can\nreduce their monthly payments so that student debt doesn\'t derail\nanyone\'s dreams.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to Vice President Biden\'s great work to update our job training\nsystem, we\'re connecting community colleges with local employers to\ntrain workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding and nursing and\nrobotics. Tonight I\'m also asking more businesses to follow the lead of\ncompanies like CVS and UPS and offer more educational benefits and paid\napprenticeships, opportunities that give workers the chance to earn\nhigher paying jobs even if they don\'t have a higher education.</p>\n\n<p>And as a new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every\nopportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend. Already,\nwe\'ve made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the\nhighest quality care. We\'re slashing the backlog that had too many\nveterans waiting years to get the benefits they need. And we\'re making\nit easier for vets to translate their training and experience into\ncivilian jobs. And Joining Forces, the national campaign launched by\nMichelle and Jill Biden  thank you, Michelle; thank you, Jillhas helped\nnearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get a new job. So to every\nCEO in America, let me repeat: If you want somebody who\'s going to get\nthe job done and done right, hire a veteran.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep\nchurning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill. Since 2010, America\nhas put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced\neconomies combined.</p>\n\n<p>Our manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs. Some of our\nbedrock sectors, like our auto industry, are booming. But there are also\nmillions of Americans who work in jobs that didn\'t even exist 10 or 20\nyears ago, jobs at companies like Google and eBay and Tesla.</p>\n\n<p>So no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of\nthe future. But we do know we want them here in America. We know that.\nAnd that\'s why the third part of middle class economics is all about\nbuilding the most competitive economy anywhere, the place where\nbusinesses want to locate and hire.</p>\n\n<p>Twenty-first century businesses need 21st-century infrastructure: modern\nports and stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest Internet.\nDemocrats and Republicans used to agree on this. So let\'s set our sights\nhigher than a single oil pipeline. Let\'s pass a bipartisan\ninfrastructure plan that could create more than 30 times as many jobs\nper year and make this country stronger for decades to come. Let\'s do\nit. Let\'s get it done. Let\'s get it done.</p>\n\n<p>Twenty-first century businesses, including small businesses, need to\nsell more American products overseas. Today, our businesses export more\nthan ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages. But as\nwe speak, China wants to write the rules for the world\'s fastest growing\nregion. That would put our workers and our businesses at a disadvantage.\nWhy would we let that happen? We should write those rules. We should\nlevel the playing field. And that\'s why I\'m asking both parties to give\nme trade promotion authority to protect American workers, with strong\nnew trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren\'t just free, but are also\nfair. It\'s the right thing to do.</p>\n\n<p>Look, I\'m the first one to admit that past trade deals haven\'t always\nlived up to the hype, and that\'s why we\'ve gone after countries that\nbreak the rules at our expense. But 95 percent of the world\'s customers\nlive outside our borders. We can\'t close ourselves off from those\nopportunities. More than half of manufacturing executives have said\nthey\'re actively looking to bring jobs back from China. So let\'s give\nthem one more reason to get it done.</p>\n\n<p>Twenty-first century businesses will rely on American science and\ntechnology, research and development. I want the country that eliminated\npolio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine, one\nthat delivers the right treatment at the right time.</p>\n\n<p>In some patients with cystic fibrosis, this approach has reversed a\ndisease once thought unstoppable. So tonight I\'m launching a new\nprecision medicine initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like\ncancer and diabetes and to give all of us access to the personalized\ninformation we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier. We can\ndo this.</p>\n\n<p>I intend to protect a free and open Internet, extend its reach to every\nclassroom and every community and help folks build the fastest networks\nso that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have\nthe platform to keep reshaping our world. I want Americans to win the\nrace for the kinds of discoveries that unleash new jobs: converting\nsunlight into liquid fuel; creating revolutionary prosthetics so that a\nveteran who gave his arms for his country can play catch with his kids\nagain; pushing out into the solar system not just to visit, but to stay.\nLast month, we launched a new spacecraft as part of a reenergized space\nprogram that will send American astronauts to Mars. And in 2 months, to\nprepare us for those missions, Scott Kelly will begin a year-long stay\nin space. So good luck, Captain. Make sure to Instagram it. We\'re proud\nof you.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the truth is, when it comes to issues like infrastructure and basic\nresearch, I know there\'s bipartisan support in this Chamber. Members of\nboth parties have told me so. Where we too often run onto the rocks is\nhow to pay for these investments. As Americans, we don\'t mind paying our\nfair share of taxes as long as everybody else does too. But for far too\nlong, lobbyists have rigged the Tax Code with loopholes that let some\ncorporations pay nothing while others pay full freight. They\'ve riddled\nit with giveaways that the super-rich don\'t need, while denying a break\nto middle class families who do.</p>\n\n<p>This year, we have an opportunity to change that. Let\'s close loopholes\nso we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad and reward those\nthat invest here in America. Let\'s use those savings to rebuild our\ninfrastructure and to make it more attractive for companies to bring\njobs home. Let\'s simplify the system and let a small-business owner file\nbased on her actual bank statement, instead of the number of accountants\nshe can afford. And let\'s close the loopholes that lead to inequality by\nallowing the top 1 percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated\nwealth. We can use that money to help more families pay for childcare\nand send their kids to college. We need a Tax Code that truly helps\nworking Americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy, and we can\nachieve that together. We can achieve it together.</p>\n\n<p>Helping hard-working families make ends meet, giving them the tools they\nneed for good-paying jobs in this new economy, maintaining the\nconditions of growth and competitivenessthis is where America needs to\ngo. I believe it\'s where the American people want to go. It will make\nour economy stronger a year from now, 15 years from now, and deep into\nthe century ahead.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, if there\'s one thing this new century has taught us, it\'s\nthat we cannot separate our work here at home from challenges beyond our\nshores. My first duty as Commander in Chief is to defend the United\nStates of America. In doing so, the question is not whether America\nleads in the world, but how. When we make rash decisions, reacting to\nthe headlines instead of using our heads, when the first response to a\nchallenge is to send in our military, then we risk getting drawn into\nunnecessary conflicts and neglect the broader strategy we need for a\nsafer, more prosperous world. That\'s what our enemies want us to do.</p>\n\n<p>I believe in a smarter kind of American leadership. We lead best when we\ncombine military power with strong diplomacy, when we leverage our power\nwith coalition building, when we don\'t let our fears blind us to the\nopportunities that this new century presents. That\'s exactly what we\'re\ndoing right now. And around the globe, it is making a difference.</p>\n\n<p>First, we stand united with people around the world who have been\ntargeted by terrorists, from a school in Pakistan to the streets of\nParis. We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their\nnetworks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we have done\nrelentlessly since I took office, to take out terrorists who pose a\ndirect threat to us and our allies. At the same time, we\'ve learned some\ncostly lessons over the last 13 years. Instead of Americans patrolling\nthe valleys of Afghanistan, we\'ve trained their security forces, who\nhave now taken the lead, and we\'ve honored our troops\' sacrifice by\nsupporting that country\'s first democratic transition. Instead of\nsending large ground forces overseas, we\'re partnering with nations from\nSouth Asia to North Africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten\nAmerica.</p>\n\n<p>In Iraq and Syria, American leadershipincluding our military poweris\nstopping ISIL\'s advance. Instead of getting dragged into another ground\nwar in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab\nnations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group. We\'re\nalso supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this\neffort and assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt\nideology of violent extremism.</p>\n\n<p>Now, this effort will take time. It will require focus. But we will\nsucceed. And tonight I call on this Congress to show the world that we\nare united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use\nof force against ISIL. We need that authority.</p>\n\n<p>Second, we\'re demonstrating the power of American strength and\ndiplomacy. We\'re upholding the principle that bigger nations can\'t bully\nthe small, by opposing Russian aggression and supporting Ukraine\'s\ndemocracy and reassuring our NATO allies.</p>\n\n<p>Last year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along\nwith our allies, as we were reinforcing our presence with frontline\nstates, Mr. Putin\'s aggression, it was suggested, was a masterful\ndisplay of strategy and strength. That\'s what I heard from some folks.\nWell, today, it is America that stands strong and united with our\nallies, while Russia is isolated with its economy in tatters. That\'s how\nAmerica leads: not with bluster, but with persistent, steady resolve.</p>\n\n<p>In Cuba, we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date.\nWhen what you\'re doing doesn\'t work for 50 years, it\'s time to try\nsomething new. And our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a\nlegacy of mistrust in our hemisphere. It removes a phony excuse for\nrestrictions in Cuba. It stands up for democratic values and extends the\nhand of friendship to the Cuban people. And this year, Congress should\nbegin the work of ending the embargo.</p>\n\n<p>As His Holiness Pope Francis has said, diplomacy is the work of "small\nsteps." And these small steps have added up to new hope for the future\nin Cuba. And after years in prison, we are overjoyed that Alan Gross is\nback where he belongs. Welcome home, Alan. We\'re glad you\'re here.</p>\n\n<p>Our diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran, where, for the first time\nin a decade, we\'ve halted the progress of its nuclear program and\nreduced its stockpile of nuclear material. Between now and this spring,\nwe have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a\nnuclear-armed Iran, secures America and our allies, including Israel,\nwhile avoiding yet another Middle East conflict. There are no guarantees\nthat negotiations will succeed, and I keep all options on the table to\nprevent a nuclear Iran.</p>\n\n<p>But new sanctions passed by this Congress, at this moment in time, will\nall but guarantee that diplomacy fails: alienating America from its\nallies, making it harder to maintain sanctions, and ensuring that Iran\nstarts up its nuclear program again. It doesn\'t make sense. And that\'s\nwhy I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this\nprogress. The American people expect us only to go to war as a last\nresort, and I intend to stay true to that wisdom. Third, we\'re looking\nbeyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming\ncentury. No foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our\nnetworks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American\nfamilies, especially our kids. So we\'re making sure our Government\nintegrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have done to\ncombat terrorism.</p>\n\n<p>And tonight I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need\nto better meet the evolving threat of cyber attacks, combat identity\ntheft, and protect our children\'s information. That should be a\nbipartisan effort. If we don\'t act, we\'ll leave our Nation and our\neconomy vulnerable. If we do, we can continue to protect the\ntechnologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around\nthe globe.</p>\n\n<p>In West Africa, our troops, our scientists, our doctors, our nurses, our\nhealth care workers are rolling back Ebola, saving countless lives and\nstopping the spread of disease. I could not be prouder of them, and I\nthank this Congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts. But\nthe job is not yet done, and the world needs to use this lesson to build\na more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future\npandemics, invest in smart development, and eradicate extreme poverty.</p>\n\n<p>In the Asia-Pacific, we are modernizing alliances while making sure that\nother nations play by the rules: in how they trade, how they resolve\nmaritime disputes, how they participate in meeting common international\nchallenges like nonproliferation and disaster relief. And no challengeno\nchallengeposes a greater threat to future generations than climate\nchange.</p>\n\n<p>Two thousand fourteen was the planet\'s warmest year on record. Now, 1\nyear doesn\'t make a trend, but this does: 14 of the 15 warmest years on\nrecord have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I\'ve heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying they\'re\nnot scientists, that we don\'t have enough information to act. Well, I\'m\nnot a scientist, either. But you know what, I know a lot of really good\nscientistsat NASA and at NOAA and at our major universities. And the\nbest scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are\nchanging the climate, and if we don\'t act forcefully, we\'ll continue to\nsee rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and\nfloods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration and\nconflict and hunger around the globe. The Pentagon says that climate\nchange poses immediate risks to our national security. We should act\nlike it.</p>\n\n<p>And that\'s why, over the past 6 years, we\'ve done more than ever to\ncombat climate change, from the way we produce energy to the way we use\nit. That\'s why we\'ve set aside more public lands and waters than any\nadministration in history. And that\'s why I will not let this Congress\nendanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our\nefforts. I am determined to make sure that American leadership drives\ninternational action.</p>\n\n<p>In Beijing, we made a historic announcement: The United States will\ndouble the pace at which we cut carbon pollution. And China committed,\nfor the first time, to limiting their emissions. And because the world\'s\ntwo largest economies came together, other nations are now stepping up\nand offering hope that this year the world will finally reach an\nagreement to protect the one planet we\'ve got.</p>\n\n<p>And there\'s one last pillar of our leadership, and that\'s the example of\nour values. As Americans, we respect human dignity, even when we\'re\nthreatened, which is why I have prohibited torture and worked to make\nsure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained. It\'s\nwhy we speak out against the deplorable anti-Semitism that has\nresurfaced in certain parts of the world. It\'s why we continue to reject\noffensive stereotypes of Muslims, the vast majority of whom share our\ncommitment to peace. That\'s why we defend free speech and advocate for\npolitical prisoners and condemn the persecution of women or religious\nminorities or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. We\ndo these things not only because they are the right thing to do, but\nbecause ultimately, they will make us safer.</p>\n\n<p>As Americans, we have a profound commitment to justice. So it makes no\nsense to spend $3 million per prisoner to keep open a prison that the\nworld condemns and terrorists use to recruit. Since I\'ve been President,\nwe\'ve worked responsibly to cut the population of Gitmo in half. Now it\nis time to finish the job. And I will not relent in my determination to\nshut it down. It is not who we are. It\'s time to close Gitmo.</p>\n\n<p>As Americans, we cherish our civil liberties, and we need to uphold that\ncommitment if we want maximum cooperation from other countries and\nindustry in our fight against terrorist networks. So while some have\nmoved on from the debates over our surveillance programs, I have not. As\npromised, our intelligence agencies have worked hard, with the\nrecommendations of privacy advocates, to increase transparency and build\nmore safeguards against potential abuse. And next month, we\'ll issue a\nreport on how we\'re keeping our promise to keep our country safe while\nstrengthening privacy.</p>\n\n<p>Looking to the future instead of the past, making sure we match our\npower with diplomacy and use force wisely, building coalitions to meet\nnew challenges and opportunities, leading always with the example of our\nvaluesthat\'s what makes us exceptional. That\'s what keeps us strong.\nThat\'s why we have to keep striving to hold ourselves to the highest of\nstandards: our own.</p>\n\n<p>You know, just over a decade ago, I gave a speech in Boston where I said\nthere wasn\'t a liberal America or a conservative America, a Black\nAmerica or a White America, but a United States of America. I said this\nbecause I had seen it in my own life, in a nation that gave someone like\nme a chance; because I grew up in Hawaii, a melting pot of races and\ncustoms; because I made Illinois my home, a State of small towns, rich\nfarmland, one of the world\'s great cities, a microcosm of the country\nwhere Democrats and Republicans and Independents, good people of every\nethnicity and every faith, share certain bedrock values.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past 6 years, the pundits have pointed out more than once that\nmy Presidency hasn\'t delivered on this vision. How ironic, they say,\nthat our politics seems more divided than ever. It\'s held up as proof\nnot just of my own flawsof which there are manybut also as proof that\nthe vision itself is misguided, naive, that there are too many people in\nthis town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for us to\never do anything about it.</p>\n\n<p>I know how tempting such cynicism may be. But I still think the cynics\nare wrong. I still believe that we are one people. I still believe that\ntogether, we can do great things, even when the odds are long.</p>\n\n<p>I believe this because over and over in my 6 years in office, I have\nseen America at its best. I\'ve seen the hopeful faces of young graduates\nfrom New York to California and our newest officers at West Point,\nAnnapolis, Colorado Springs, New London. I\'ve mourned with grieving\nfamilies in Tucson and Newtown, in Boston, in West, Texas, and West\nVirginia. I\'ve watched Americans beat back adversity from the Gulf Coast\nto the Great Plains, from Midwest assembly lines to the Mid-Atlantic\nseaboard. I\'ve seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue\nused to drive us apart to a story of freedom across our country, a civil\nright now legal in States that 7 in 10 Americans call home. So I know\nthe good and optimistic and big-hearted generosity of the American\npeople who every day live the idea that we are our brother\'s keeper and\nour sister\'s keeper. And I know they expect those of us who serve here\nto set a better example.</p>\n\n<p>So the question for those of us here tonight is how we, all of us, can\nbetter reflect America\'s hopes. I\'ve served in Congress with many of\nyou. I know many of you well. There are a lot of good people here on\nboth sides of the aisle. And many of you have told me that this isn\'t\nwhat you signed up for: arguing past each other on cable shows, the\nconstant fundraising, always looking over your shoulder at how the base\nwill react to every decision.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine if we broke out of these tired old patterns. Imagine if we did\nsomething different. Understand, a better politics isn\'t one where\nDemocrats abandon their agenda or Republicans simply embrace mine. A\nbetter politics is one where we appeal to each other\'s basic decency\ninstead of our basest fears. A better politics is one where we debate\nwithout demonizing each other, where we talk issues and values and\nprinciples and facts rather than "gotcha" moments or trivial gaffes or\nfake controversies that have nothing to do with people\'s daily lives.</p>\n\n<p>A politicsa better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in\ndark money for ads that pull us into the gutter and spend more time\nlifting young people up with a sense of purpose and possibility, asking\nthem to join in the great mission of building America.</p>\n\n<p>If we\'re going to have arguments, let\'s have arguments, but let\'s make\nthem debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country. We still\nmay not agree on a woman\'s right to choose, but surely we can agree it\'s\na good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing alltime\nlows and that every woman should have access to the health care that she\nneeds.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, passions still fly on immigration, but surely we can all see\nsomething of ourselves in the striving young student and agree that no\none benefits when a hard-working mom is snatched from her child and that\nit\'s possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of\nlaws and a nation of immigrants. I\'ve talked to Republicans and\nDemocrats about that. That\'s something that we can share.</p>\n\n<p>We may go at it in campaign season, but surely we can agree that the\nright to vote is sacred, that it\'s being denied to too many, and that on\nthis 50th anniversary of the great march from Selma to Montgomery and\nthe passage of the Voting Rights Act, we can come together, Democrats\nand Republicans, to make voting easier for every single American.</p>\n\n<p>We may have different takes on the events of Ferguson and New York. But\nsurely we can understand a father who fears his son can\'t walk home\nwithout being harassed. And surely we can understand the wife who won\'t\nrest until the police officer she married walks through the front door\nat the end of his shift. And surely we can agree that it\'s a good thing\nthat for the first time in 40 years, the crime rate and the\nincarceration rate have come down together, and use that as a starting\npoint for Democrats and Republicans, community leaders and law\nenforcement, to reform America\'s criminal justice system so that it\nprotects and serves all of us.</p>\n\n<p>That\'s a better politics. That\'s how we start rebuilding trust. That\'s\nhow we move this country forward. That\'s what the American people want.\nAnd that\'s what they deserve.</p>\n\n<p>I have no more campaigns to run.</p>\n\n<p>My only agenda</p>\n\n<p>I know because I won both of them. My only agenda for the next 2 years\nis the same as the one I\'ve had since the day I swore an oath on the\nsteps of this Capitol: to do what I believe is best for America. If you\nshare the broad vision I outlined tonight, I ask you to join me in the\nwork at hand. If you disagree with parts of it, I hope you\'ll at least\nwork with me where you do agree. And I commit to every Republican here\ntonight that I will not only seek out your ideas, I will seek to work\nwith you to make this country stronger.</p>\n\n<p>Because I want this Chamber, I want this city to reflect the truth: that\nfor all our blind spots and shortcomings, we are a people with the\nstrength and generosity of spirit to bridge divides, to unite in common\neffort, to help our neighbors, whether down the street or on the other\nside of the world.</p>\n\n<p>I want our actions to tell every child in every neighborhood, your life\nmatters, and we are committed to improving your life chances, as\ncommitted as we are to working on behalf of our own kids. I want future\ngenerations to know that we are a people who see our differences as a\ngreat gift, that we\'re a people who value the dignity and worth of every\ncitizen: man and woman, young and old, Black and White, Latino, Asian,\nimmigrant, Native American, gay, straight, Americans with mental illness\nor physical disability. Everybody matters. I want them to grow up in a\ncountry that shows the world what we still know to be true: that we are\nstill more than a collection of red States and blue States, that we are\nthe United States of America.</p>\n\n<p>I want them to grow up in a country where a young mom can sit down and\nwrite a letter to her President with a story that sums up these past 6\nyears: "It\'s amazing what you can bounce back from when you have to. . .\n. We are a strong, tight-knit family who\'s made it through some very,\nvery hard times."</p>\n\n<p>My fellow Americans, we too are a strong, tight-knit family. We too have\nmade it through some hard times. Fifteen years into this new century, we\nhave picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and begun again the work\nof remaking America. We have laid a new foundation. A brighter future is\nours to write. Let\'s begin this new chapter together, and let\'s start\nthe work right now.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless this country we love. Thank you.\n</p>\n\t\t\t<div class="textNav"><a href="#top">^ Return to top</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>\n\t<div id="footer"><strong><em>State of the Union</em></strong> is a project\n\t\tby Brad Borevitz at <a href="http://www.onetwothree.net">onetwothree.net</a></div>\n</div>\n<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">\n</script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n_uacct = "UA-410742-1";\nurchinTracker();\n</script>\n</body>\n<!-- InstanceEnd -->\n</html>\n'
