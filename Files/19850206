Out of that change has come great\nand robust growth--in our confidence, our economy, and our role in the\nworld.</p>\n\n<p>Tonight America is stronger because of the values that we hold dear. We\nbelieve faith and freedom must be our guiding stars, for they show us\ntruth, they make us brave, give us hope, and leave us wiser than we were.\nOur progress began not in Washington, DC, but in the hearts of our\nfamilies, communities, workplaces, and voluntary groups which, together,\nare unleashing the invincible spirit of one great nation under God.</p>\n\n<p>Four years ago we said we would invigorate our economy by giving people\ngreater freedom and incentives to take risks and letting them keep more of\nwhat they earned. We did what we promised, and a great industrial giant is\nreborn.</p>\n\n<p>Tonight we can take pride in 25 straight months of economic growth, the\nstrongest in 34 years; a 3-year inflation average of 3.9 percent, the\nlowest in 17 years; and 7.3 million new jobs in 2 years, with more of our\ncitizens working than ever before.</p>\n\n<p>New freedom in our lives has planted the rich seeds for future success:</p>\n\n<p>For an America of wisdom that honors the family, knowing that if (as) the\nfamily goes, so goes our civilization;</p>\n\n<p>For an America of vision that sees tomorrow\'s dreams in the learning and\nhard work we do today;</p>\n\n<p>For an America of courage whose service men and women, even as we meet,\nproudly stand watch on the frontiers of freedom;</p>\n\n<p>For an America of compassion that opens its heart to those who cry out for\nhelp.</p>\n\n<p>We have begun well. But it\'s only a beginning. We\'re not here to\ncongratulate ourselves on what we have done but to challenge ourselves to\nfinish what has not yet been done.</p>\n\n<p>We\'re here to speak for millions in our inner cities who long for real\njobs, safe neighborhoods, and schools that truly teach. We\'re here to speak\nfor the American farmer, the entrepreneur, and every worker in industries\nfighting to modernize and compete. And, yes, we\'re here to stand, and\nproudly so, for all who struggle to break free from totalitarianism, for\nall who know in their hearts that freedom is the one true path to peace and\nhuman happiness.</p>\n\n<p>Proverbs tell us, without a vision the people perish. When asked what great\nprinciple holds our Union together, Abraham Lincoln said: "Something in\n(the) Declaration giving liberty, not alone to the people of this country,\nbut hope to the world for all future time."</p>\n\n<p>We honor the giants of our history not by going back but forward to the\ndreams their vision foresaw. My fellow citizens, this nation is poised for\ngreatness. The time has come to proceed toward a great new challenge--a\nsecond American Revolution of hope and opportunity; a revolution carrying\nus to new heights of progress by pushing back frontiers of knowledge and\nspace; a revolution of spirit that taps the soul of America, enabling us to\nsummon greater strength than we\'ve ever known; and a revolution that\ncarries beyond our shores the golden promise of human freedom in a world of\npeace.</p>\n\n<p>Let us begin by challenging our conventional wisdom. There are no\nconstraints on the human mind, no walls around the human spirit, no\nbarriers to our progress except those we ourselves erect. Already, pushing\ndown tax rates has freed our economy to vault forward to record growth.</p>\n\n<p>In Europe, they\'re calling it "the American Miracle." Day by day, we\'re\nshattering accepted notions of what is possible. When I was growing up, we\nfailed to see how a new thing called radio would transform our marketplace.\nWell, today, many have not yet seen how advances in technology are\ntransforming our lives.</p>\n\n<p>In the late 1950\'s workers at the AT&T semiconductor plant in Pennsylvania\nproduced five transistors a day for $7.50 apiece. They now produce over a\nmillion for less than a penny apiece.</p>\n\n<p>New laser techniques could revolutionize heart bypass surgery, cut\ndiagnosis time for viruses linked to cancer from weeks to minutes, reduce\nhospital costs dramatically, and hold out new promise for saving human\nlives.</p>\n\n<p>Our automobile industry has overhauled assembly lines, increased worker\nproductivity, and is competitive once again.</p>\n\n<p>We stand on the threshold of a great ability to produce more, do more, be\nmore. Our economy is not getting older and weaker; it\'s getting younger and\nstronger. It doesn\'t need rest and supervision; it needs new challenge,\ngreater freedom. And that word "freedom" is the key to the second American\nrevolution that we need to bring about.</p>\n\n<p>Let us move together with an historic reform of tax simplification for\nfairness and growth. Last year I asked Treasury Secretary-then-Regan to\ndevelop a plan to simplify the tax code, so all taxpayers would be treated\nmore fairly and personal tax rates could come further down.</p>\n\n<p>We have cut tax rates by almost 25 percent, yet the tax system remains\nunfair and limits our potential for growth. Exclusions and exemptions cause\nsimilar incomes to be taxed at different levels. Low-income families face\nsteep tax barriers that make hard lives even harder. The Treasury\nDepartment has produced an excellent reform plan, whose principles will\nguide the final proposal that we will ask you to enact.</p>\n\n<p>One thing that tax reform will not be is a tax increase in disguise. We\nwill not jeopardize the mortgage interest deduction that families need. We\nwill reduce personal tax rates as low as possible by removing many tax\npreferences. We will propose a top rate of no more than 35 percent, and\npossibly lower. And we will propose reducing corporate rates, while\nmaintaining incentives for capital formation.</p>\n\n<p>To encourage opportunity and jobs rather than dependency and welfare, we\nwill propose that individuals living at or near the poverty line be totally\nexempt from Federal income tax. To restore fairness to families, we will\npropose increasing significantly the personal exemption.</p>\n\n<p>And tonight, I am instructing Treasury Secretary James Baker--I have to get\nused to saying that--to begin working with congressional authors and\ncommittees for bipartisan legislation conforming to these principles. We\nwill call upon the American people for support and upon every man and woman\nin this Chamber. Together, we can pass, this year, a tax bill for fairness,\nsimplicity, and growth, making this economy the engine of our dreams and\nAmerica the investment capital of the world. So let us begin.</p>\n\n<p>Tax simplification will be a giant step toward unleashing the tremendous\npent-up power of our economy. But a second American revolution must carry\nthe promise of opportunity for all. It is time to liberate the spirit of\nenterprise in the most distressed areas of our country.</p>\n\n<p>This government will meet its responsibility to help those in need. But\npolicies that increase dependency, break up families, and destroy\nself-respect are not progressive; they\'re reactionary. Despite our strides\nin civil rights, blacks, Hispanics, and all minorities will not have full\nand equal power until they have full economic power.</p>\n\n<p>We have repeatedly sought passage of enterprise zones to help those in the\nabandoned corners of our land find jobs, learn skills, and build better\nlives. This legislation is supported by a majority of you.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Speaker, I know we agree that there must be no forgotten Americans.\nLet us place new dreams in a million hearts and create a new generation of\nentrepreneurs by passing enterprise zones this year. And, Tip, you could\nmake that a birthday present.</p>\n\n<p>Nor must we lose the chance to pass our youth employment opportunity wage\nproposal. We can help teenagers, who have the highest unemployment rate,\nfind summer jobs, so they can know the pride of work and have confidence in\ntheir futures.</p>\n\n<p>We\'ll continue to support the Job Training Partnership Act, which has a\nnearly two-thirds job placement rate. Credits in education and health care\nvouchers will help working families shop for services that they need.</p>\n\n<p>Our administration is already encouraging certain low-income public housing\nresidents to own and manage their own dwellings. It\'s time that all public\nhousing residents have that opportunity of ownership.</p>\n\n<p>The Federal Government can help create a new atmosphere of freedom. But\nStates and localities, many of which enjoy surpluses from the recovery,\nmust not permit their tax and regulatory policies to stand as barriers to\ngrowth.</p>\n\n<p>Let us resolve that we will stop spreading dependency and start spreading\nopportunity; that we will stop spreading bondage and start spreading\nfreedom.</p>\n\n<p>There are some who say that growth initiatives must await final action on\ndeficit reductions. Well, the best way to reduce deficits is through\neconomic growth. More businesses will be started, more investments made,\nmore jobs created, and more people will be on payrolls paying taxes. The\nbest way to reduce government spending is to reduce the need for spending\nby increasing prosperity. Each added percentage point per year of real GNP\ngrowth will lead to cumulative reduction in deficits of nearly $200 billion\nover 5 years.</p>\n\n<p>To move steadily toward a balanced budget, we must also lighten\ngovernment\'s claim on our total economy. We will not do this by raising\ntaxes. We must make sure that our economy grows faster than the growth in\nspending by the Federal Government. In our fiscal year 1986 budget, overall\ngovernment program spending will be frozen at the current level. It must\nnot be one dime higher than fiscal year 1985, and three points are key.</p>\n\n<p>First, the social safety net for the elderly, the needy, the disabled, and\nunemployed will be left intact. Growth of our major health care programs,\nMedicare and Medicaid, will be slowed, but protections for the elderly and\nneedy will be preserved.</p>\n\n<p>Second, we must not relax our efforts to restore military strength just as\nwe near our goal of a fully equipped, trained, and ready professional\ncorps. National security is government\'s first responsibility; so in past\nyears defense spending took about half the Federal budget. Today it takes\nless than a third. We\'ve already reduced our planned defense expenditures\nby nearly a hundred billion dollars over the past 4 years and reduced\nprojected spending again this year.</p>\n\n<p>You know, we only have a military-industrial complex until a time of\ndanger, and then it becomes the arsenal of democracy. Spending for defense\nis investing in things that are priceless--peace and freedom.</p>\n\n<p>Third, we must reduce or eliminate costly government subsidies. For\nexample, deregulation of the airline industry has led to cheaper airfares,\nbut on Amtrak taxpayers pay about $35 per passenger every time an Amtrak\ntrain leaves the station, It\'s time we ended this huge Federal subsidy.</p>\n\n<p>Our farm program costs have quadrupled in recent years. Yet I know from\nvisiting farmers, many in great financial distress, that we need an orderly\ntransition to a market-oriented farm economy. We can help farmers best not\nby expanding Federal payments but by making fundamental reforms, keeping\ninterest rates heading down, and knocking down foreign trade barriers to\nAmerican farm exports.</p>\n\n<p>We\'re moving ahead with Grace commission reforms to eliminate waste and\nimprove government\'s management practices. In the long run, we must protect\nthe taxpayers from government. And I ask again that you pass, as 32 States\nhave now called for, an amendment mandating the Federal Government spend no\nmore than it takes in. And I ask for the authority, used responsibly by 43\nGovernors, to veto individual items in appropriation bills. Senator\nMattingly has introduced a bill permitting a 2-year trial run of the\nline-item veto. I hope you\'ll pass and send that legislation to my desk.</p>\n\n<p>Nearly 50 years of government living beyond its means has brought us to a\ntime of reckoning. Ours is but a moment in history. But one moment of\ncourage, idealism, and bipartisan unity can change American history\nforever.</p>\n\n<p>Sound monetary policy is key to long-running economic strength and\nstability. We will continue to cooperate with the Federal Reserve Board,\nseeking a steady policy that ensures price stability without keeping\ninterest rates artificially high or needlessly holding down growth.</p>\n\n<p>Reducing unneeded red tape and regulations, and deregulating the energy,\ntransportation, and financial industries have unleashed new competition,\ngiving consumers more choices, better services, and lower prices. In just\none set of grant programs we have reduced 905 pages of regulations to 31.\nWe seek to fully deregulate natural gas to bring on new supplies and bring\nus closer to energy independence. Consistent with safety standards, we will\ncontinue removing restraints on the bus and railroad industries, we will\nsoon end up legislation--or send up legislation, I should say--to return\nConrail to the private sector where it belongs, and we will support further\nderegulation of the trucking industry.</p>\n\n<p>Every dollar the Federal Government does not take from us, every decision\nit does not make for us will make our economy stronger, our lives more\nabundant, our future more free.</p>\n\n<p>Our second American revolution will push on to new possibilities not only\non Earth but in the next frontier of space. Despite budget restraints, we\nwill seek record funding for research and development.</p>\n\n<p>We\'ve seen the success of the space shuttle. Now we\'re going to develop a\npermanently manned space station and new opportunities for free enterprise,\nbecause in the next decade Americans and our friends around the world will\nbe living and working together in space.</p>\n\n<p>In the zero gravity of space, we could manufacture in 30 days lifesaving\nmedicines it would take 30 years to make on Earth. We can make crystals of\nexceptional purity to produce super computers, creating jobs, technologies,\nand medical breakthroughs beyond anything we ever dreamed possible.</p>\n\n<p>As we do all this, we\'ll continue to protect our natural resources. We will\nseek reauthorization and expanded funding for the Superfund program to\ncontinue cleaning up hazardous waste sites which threaten human health and\nthe environment.</p>\n\n<p>Now, there\'s another great heritage to speak of this evening. Of all the\nchanges that have swept America the past 4 years, none brings greater\npromise than our rediscovery of the values of faith, freedom, family, work,\nand neighborhood.</p>\n\n<p>We see signs of renewal in increased attendance in places of worship;\nrenewed optimism and faith in our future; love of country rediscovered by\nour young, who are leading the way. We\'ve rediscovered that work is good in\nand of itself, that it ennobles us to create and contribute no matter how\nseemingly humble our jobs. We\'ve seen a powerful new current from an old\nand honorable tradition--American generosity.</p>\n\n<p>From thousands answering Peace Corps appeals to help boost food production\nin Africa, to millions volunteering time, corporations adopting schools,\nand communities pulling together to help the neediest among us at home, we\nhave refound our values. Private sector initiatives are crucial to our\nfuture.</p>\n\n<p>I thank the Congress for passing equal access legislation giving religious\ngroups the same right to use classrooms after school that other groups\nenjoy. But no citizen need tremble, nor the world shudder, if a child\nstands in a classroom and breathes a prayer. We ask you again, give\nchildren back a right they had for a century and a half or more in this\ncountry.</p>\n\n<p>The question of abortion grips our nation. Abortion is either the taking of\na human life or it isn\'t. And if it is--and medical technology is\nincreasingly showing it is--it must be stopped. It is a terrible irony that\nwhile some turn to abortion, so many others who cannot become parents cry\nout for children to adopt. We have room for these children. We can fill the\ncradles of those who want a child to love. And tonight I ask you in the\nCongress to move this year on legislation to protect the unborn.</p>\n\n<p>In the area of education, we\'re returning to excellence, and again, the\nheroes are our people, not government. We\'re stressing basics of\ndiscipline, rigorous testing, and homework, while helping children become\ncomputer-smart as well. For 20 years scholastic aptitude test scores of our\nhigh school students went down, but now they have gone up 2 of the last 3\nyears. We must go forward in our commitment to the new basics, giving\nparents greater authority and making sure good teachers are rewarded for\nhard work and achievement through merit pay.</p>\n\n<p>Of all the changes in the past 20 years, none has more threatened our sense\nof national well-being than the explosion of violent crime. One does not\nhave to be attacked to be a victim. The woman who must run to her car after\nshopping at night is a victim. The couple draping their door with locks and\nchains are victims; as is the tired, decent cleaning woman who can\'t ride a\nsubway home without being afraid.</p>\n\n<p>We do not seek to violate the rights of defendants. But shouldn\'t we feel\nmore compassion for the victims of crime than for those who commit crime?\nFor the first time in 20 years, the crime index has fallen 2 years in a\nrow. We\'ve convicted over 7,400 drug offenders and put them, as well as\nleaders of organized crime, behind bars in record numbers.</p>\n\n<p>But we must do more. I urge the House to follow the Senate and enact\nproposals permitting use of all reliable evidence that police officers\nacquire in good faith. These proposals would also reform the habeas corpus\nlaws and allow, in keeping with the will of the overwhelming majority of\nAmericans, the use of the death penalty where necessary.</p>\n\n<p>There can be no economic revival in ghettos when the most violent among us\nare allowed to roam free. It\'s time we restored domestic tranquility. And\nwe mean to do just that.</p>\n\n<p>Just as we\'re positioned as never before to secure justice in our economy,\nwe\'re poised as never before to create a safer, freer, more peaceful world.\nOur alliances are stronger than ever. Our economy is stronger than ever. We\nhave resumed our historic role as a leader of the free world. And all of\nthese together are a great force for peace.</p>\n\n<p>Since 1981 we\'ve been committed to seeking fair and verifiable arms\nagreements that would lower the risk of war and reduce the size of nuclear\narsenals. Now our determination to maintain a strong defense has influenced\nthe Soviet Union to return to the bargaining table. Our negotiators must be\nable to go to that table with the united support of the American people.\nAll of us have no greater dream than to see the day when nuclear weapons\nare banned from this Earth forever.</p>\n\n<p>Each Member of the Congress has a role to play in modernizing our defenses,\nthus supporting our chances for a meaningful arms agreement. Your vote this\nspring on the Peacekeeper missile will be a critical test of our resolve to\nmaintain the strength we need and move toward mutual and verifiable arms\nreductions.</p>\n\n<p>For the past 20 years we\'ve believed that no war will be launched as long\nas each side knows it can retaliate with a deadly counterstrike. Well, I\nbelieve there\'s a better way of eliminating the threat of nuclear war. It\nis a Strategic Defense Initiative aimed ultimately at finding a nonnuclear\ndefense against ballistic missiles. It\'s the most hopeful possibility of\nthe nuclear age. But it\'s not very well understood.</p>\n\n<p>Some say it will bring war to the heavens, but its purpose is to deter war\nin the heavens and on Earth. Now, some say the research would be expensive.\nPerhaps, but it could save millions of lives, indeed humanity itself. And\nsome say if we build such a system, the Soviets will build a defense system\nof their own. Well, they already have strategic defenses that surpass ours;\na civil defense system, where we have almost none; and a research program\ncovering roughly the same areas of technology that we\'re now exploring. And\nfinally some say the research will take a long time. Well, the answer to\nthat is: Let\'s get started.</p>\n\n<p>Harry Truman once said that, ultimately, our security and the world\'s hopes\nfor peace and human progress "lie not in measures of defense or in the\ncontrol of weapons, but in the growth and expansion of freedom and\nself-government."</p>\n\n<p>And tonight, we declare anew to our fellow citizens of the world: Freedom\nis not the sole prerogative of a chosen few; it is the universal right of\nall God\'s children. Look to where peace and prosperity flourish today. It\nis in homes that freedom built. Victories against poverty are greatest and\npeace most secure where people live by laws that ensure free press, free\nspeech, and freedom to worship, vote, and create wealth.</p>\n\n<p>Our mission is to nourish and defend freedom and democracy, and to\ncommunicate these ideals everywhere we can. America\'s economic success is\nfreedom\'s success; it can be repeated a hundred times in a hundred\ndifferent nations. Many countries in east Asia and the Pacific have few\nresources other than the enterprise of their own people. But through low\ntax rates and free markets they\'ve soared ahead of centralized economies.\nAnd now China is opening up its economy to meet its needs.</p>\n\n<p>We need a stronger and simpler approach to the process of making and\nimplementing trade policy, and we\'ll be studying potential changes in that\nprocess in the next few weeks. We\'ve seen the benefits of free trade and\nlived through the disasters of protectionism. Tonight I ask all our trading\npartners, developed and developing alike, to join us in a new round of\ntrade negotiations to expand trade and competition and strengthen the\nglobal economy--and to begin it in this next year.</p>\n\n<p>There are more than 3 billion human beings living in Third World countries\nwith an average per capita income of $650 a year. Many are victims of\ndictatorships that impoverished them with taxation and corruption. Let us\nask our allies to join us in a practical program of trade and assistance\nthat fosters economic development through personal incentives to help these\npeople climb from poverty on their own.</p>\n\n<p>We cannot play innocents abroad in a world that\'s not innocent; nor can we\nbe passive when freedom is under siege. Without resources, diplomacy cannot\nsucceed. Our security assistance programs help friendly governments defend\nthemselves and give them confidence to work for peace. And I hope that you\nin the Congress will understand that, dollar for dollar, security\nassistance contributes as much to global security as our own defense\nbudget.</p>\n\n<p>We must stand by all our democratic allies. And we must not break faith\nwith those who are risking their lives--on every continent, from\nAfghanistan to Nicaragua--to defy Soviet-supported aggression and secure\nrights which have been ours from birth.</p>\n\n<p>The Sandinista dictatorship of Nicaragua, with full Cuban-Soviet bloc\nsupport, not only persecutes its people, the church, and denies a free\npress, but arms and provides bases for Communist terrorists attacking\nneighboring states. Support for freedom fighters is self-defense and\ntotally consistent with the OAS and U.N. Charters. It is essential that the\nCongress continue all facets of our assistance to Central America. I want\nto work with you to support the democratic forces whose struggle is tied to\nour own security.</p>\n\n<p>And tonight, I\'ve spoken of great plans and great dreams. They\'re dreams we\ncan make come true. Two hundred years of American history should have\ntaught us that nothing is impossible.</p>\n\n<p>Ten years ago a young girl left Vietnam with her family, part of the exodus\nthat followed the fall of Saigon. They came to the United States with no\npossessions and not knowing a word of English. Ten years ago--the young\ngirl studied hard, learned English, and finished high school in the top of\nher class. And this May, May 22d to be exact, is a big date on her\ncalendar. Just 10 years from the time she left Vietnam, she will graduate\nfrom the United States Military Academy at West Point. I thought you might\nlike to meet an American hero named Jean Nguyen.</p>\n\n<p>Now, there\'s someone else here tonight, born 79 years ago. She lives in the\ninner city, where she cares for infants born of mothers who are heroin\naddicts. The children, born in withdrawal, are sometimes even dropped on\nher doorstep. She helps them with love. Go to her house some night, and\nmaybe you\'ll see her silhouette against the window as she walks the floor\ntalking softly, soothing a child in her arms--Mother Hale of Harlem, and\nshe, too, is an American hero.</p>\n\n<p>Jean, Mother Hale, your lives tell us that the oldest American saying is\nnew again: Anything is possible in America if we have the faith, the will,\nand the heart. History is asking us once again to be a force for good in\nthe world. Let us begin in unity, with justice, and love.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you, and God bless you.</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: The President spoke at 9:05 p.m. in the House Chamber of the Capitol.\nHe was introduced by Thomas P. O\'Neill, Jr., Speaker of the House of\nRepresentatives.
