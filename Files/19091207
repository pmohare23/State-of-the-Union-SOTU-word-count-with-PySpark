Taft</h2>\n\t\t\t<h3>December 7, 1909</h3>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p>\nThe relations of the United States with all foreign governments have\ncontinued upon the normal basis of amity and good understanding, and are\nvery generally satisfactory. EUROPE.</p>\n\n<p>Pursuant to the provisions of the general treaty of arbitration concluded\nbetween the United States and Great Britain, April 4, 1908, a special\nagreement was entered into between the two countries on January 27, 1909,\nfor the submission of questions relating to the fisheries on the North\nAtlantic Coast to a tribunal to be formed from members of the Permanent\nCourt of Arbitration at The Hague.</p>\n\n<p>In accordance with the provisions of the special agreement the printed case\nof each Government was, on October 4 last, submitted to the other and to\nthe Arbitral Tribunal at The Hague, and the counter case of the United\nStates is now in course of preparation.</p>\n\n<p>The American rights under the fisheries article of the Treaty of 1818 have\nbeen a cause of difference between the United States and Great Britain for\nnearly seventy years. The interests involved are of great importance to the\nAmerican fishing industry, and the final settlement of the controversy will\nremove a source of constant irritation and complaint. This is the first\ncase involving such great international questions which has been submitted\nto the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.</p>\n\n<p>The treaty between the United States and Great Britain concerning the\nCanadian International boundary, concluded April 11, 1908, authorizes the\nappointment of two commissioners to define and mark accurately the\ninternational boundary line between the United States and the Dominion of\nCanada in the waters of the Passamaquoddy Bay, and provides for the\nexchange of briefs within the period of six months. The briefs were duly\npresented within the prescribed period, but as the commissioners failed to\nagree within six months after the exchange of the printed statements, as\nrequired by the treaty, it has now become necessary to resort to the\narbitration provided for in the article.</p>\n\n<p>The International Fisheries Commission appointed pursuant to and under the\nauthority of the Convention of April 11, 1908, between the United States\nand Great Britain, has completed a system of uniform and common\ninternational regulations for the protection and preservation of the food\nfishes in international boundary waters of the United States and Canada.</p>\n\n<p>The regulations will be duly submitted to Congress with a view to the\nenactment of such legislation as will be necessary under the convention to\nput them into operation.</p>\n\n<p>The Convention providing for the settlement of international differences\nbetween the United States and Canada, including the apportionment between\nthe two countries of certain of the boundary waters and the appointment of\ncommissioners to adjust certain other questions, signed on the 11th day of\nJanuary, 1909, and to the ratification of which the Senate gave its advice\nand consent on March 3, 1909, has not yet been ratified on the part of\nGreat Britain.</p>\n\n<p>Commissioners have been appointed on the part of the United States to act\njointly with Commissioners on the part of Canada in examining into the\nquestion of obstructions in the St. John River between Maine and New\nBrunswick, and to make recommendations for the regulation of the uses\nthereof, and are now engaged in this work.</p>\n\n<p>Negotiations for an international conference to consider and reach an\narrangement providing for the preservation and protection of the fur seals\nin the North Pacific are in progress with the Governments of Great Britain,\nJapan, and Russia. The attitude of the Governments interested leads me to\nhope for a satisfactory settlement of this question as the ultimate outcome\nof the negotiations.</p>\n\n<p>The Second Peace Conference recently held at The Hague adopted a convention\nfor the establishment of an International Prize Court upon the joint\nproposal of delegations of the United States, France, Germany and Great\nBritain. The law to be observed by the Tribunal in the decision of prize\ncases was, however, left in an uncertain and therefore unsatisfactory\nstate. Article 7 of the Convention provided that the Court was to be\ngoverned by the provisions of treaties existing between the belligerents,\nbut that "in the absence of such provisions, the court shall apply the\nrules of international law. If no generally recognized rule exists, the\ncourt shall give judgment in accordance with the general principles of\njustice and equity." As, however, many questions in international maritime\nlaw are understood differently and therefore interpreted differently in\nvarious countries, it was deemed advisable not to intrust legislative\npowers to the proposed court, but to determine the rules of law properly\napplicable in a Conference of the representative maritime nations. Pursuant\nto an invitation of Great Britain a conference was held at London from\nDecember 2, 1908, to February 26, 1909, in which the following Powers\nparticipated: the United States, Austria-Hungary, France, Germany, Great\nBritain, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Russia and Spain. The conference\nresulted in the Declaration of London, unanimously agreed to and signed by\nthe participating Powers, concerning among other matters, the highly\nimportant subjects of blockade, contraband, the destruction of neutral\nprizes, and continuous voyages. The declaration of London is an eminently\nsatisfactory codification of the international maritime law, and it is\nhoped that its reasonableness and fairness will secure its general\nadoption, as well as remove one of the difficulties standing in the way of\nthe establishment of an International Prize Court.</p>\n\n<p>Under the authority given in the sundry civil appropriation act, approved\nMarch 4, 1909, the United States was represented at the International\nConference on Maritime Law at Brussels. The Conference met on the 28th of\nSeptember last and resulted in the signature ad referendum of a convention\nfor the unification of certain regulations with regard to maritime\nassistance and salvage and a convention for the unification of certain\nrules with regard to collisions at sea. Two new projects of conventions\nwhich have not heretofore been considered in a diplomatic conference,\nnamely, one concerning the limitation of the responsibility of shipowners,\nand the other concerning marine mortgages and privileges, have been\nsubmitted by the Conference to the different governments.</p>\n\n<p>The Conference adjourned to meet again on April 11, 1910.</p>\n\n<p>The International Conference for the purpose of promoting uniform\nlegislation concerning letters of exchange, which was called by the\nGovernment of the Netherlands to meet at The Hague in September, 1909, has\nbeen postponed to meet at that capital in June, 1910. The United States\nwill be appropriately represented in this Conference under the provision\ntherefor already made by Congress.</p>\n\n<p>The cordial invitation of Belgium to be represented by a fitting display of\nAmerican progress in the useful arts and inventions at the World\'s Fair to\nbe held at Brussels in 1910 remains to be acted upon by the Congress.\nMindful of the advantages to accrue to our artisans and producers in\ncompetition with their Continental rivals, I renew the recommendation\nheretofore made that provision be made for acceptance of the invitation and\nadequate representation in the Exposition. The question arising out of the\nBelgian annexation of the Independent State of the Congo, which has so long\nand earnestly preoccupied the attention of this Government and enlisted the\nsympathy of our best citizens, is still open, but in a more hopeful stage.\nThis Government was among the foremost in the great work of uplifting the\nuncivilized regions of Africa and urging the extension of the benefits of\ncivilization, education, and fruitful open commerce to that vast domain,\nand is a party to treaty engagements of all the interested powers designed\nto carry out that great duty to humanity. The way to better the original\nand adventitious conditions, so burdensome to the natives and so\ndestructive to their development, has been pointed out, by observation and\nexperience, not alone of American representatives, but by cumulative\nevidence from all quarters and by the investigations of Belgian Agents. The\nannounced programmes of reforms, striking at many of the evils known to\nexist, are an augury of better things. The attitude of the United States is\none of benevolent encouragement, coupled with a hopeful trust that the good\nwork, responsibly undertaken and zealously perfected to the accomplishment\nof the results so ardently desired, will soon justify the wisdom that\ninspires them and satisfy the demands of humane sentiment throughout the\nworld.</p>\n\n<p>A convention between the United States and Germany, under which the\nnonworking provisions of the German patent law are made inapplicable to the\npatents of American citizens, was concluded on February 23, 1909, and is\nnow in force. Negotiations for similar conventions looking to the placing\nof American inventors on the same footing as nationals have recently been\ninitiated with other European governments whose laws require the local\nworking of foreign patents.</p>\n\n<p>Under an appropriation made at the last session of the Congress, a\ncommission was sent on American cruisers to Monrovia to investigate the\ninterests of the United States and its citizens in Liberia. Upon its\narrival at Monrovia the commission was enthusiastically received, and\nduring its stay in Liberia was everywhere met with the heartiest\nexpressions of good will for the American Government and people and the\nhope was repeatedly expressed on all sides that this Government might see\nits way clear to do something to relieve the critical position of the\nRepublic arising in a measure from external as well as internal and\nfinancial embarrassments. The Liberian Government afforded every facility\nto the Commission for ascertaining the true state of affairs. The\nCommission also had conferences with representative citizens, interested\nforeigners and the representatives of foreign governments in Monrovia.\nVisits were made to various parts of the Republic and to the neighboring\nBritish colony of Sierra Leone, where the Commission was received by and\nconferred with the Governor.</p>\n\n<p>It will be remembered that the interest of the United States in the\nRepublic of Liberia springs from the historical fact of the foundation of\nthe Republic by the colonization of American citizens of the African race.\nIn an early treaty with Liberia there is a provision under which the United\nStates may be called upon for advice or assistance. Pursuant to this\nprovision and in the spirit of the moral relationship of the United States\nto Liberia, that Republic last year asked this Government to lend\nassistance in the solution of certain of their national problems, and hence\nthe Commission was sent.</p>\n\n<p>The report of our commissioners has just been completed and is now under\nexamination by the Department of State. It is hoped that there may result\nsome helpful measures, in which case it may be my duty again to invite your\nattention to this subject.</p>\n\n<p>The Norwegian Government, by a note addressed on January 26, 1909, to the\nDepartment of State, conveyed an invitation to the Government of the United\nStates to take part in a conference which it is understood will be held in\nFebruary or March, 1910, for the purpose of devising means to remedy\nexisting conditions in the Spitzbergen Islands.</p>\n\n<p>This invitation was conveyed under the reservation that the question of\naltering the status of the islands as countries belonging to no particular\nState, and as equally open to the citizens and subjects of all States,\nshould not be raised.</p>\n\n<p>The European Powers invited to this Conference by the Government of Norway\nwere Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Russia, Sweden and\nthe Netherlands.</p>\n\n<p>The Department of State, in view of proofs filed with it in 1906, showing\nthe American possession, occupation, and working of certain coal-bearing\nlands in Spitzbergen, accepted the invitation under the reservation above\nstated, and under the further reservation that all interests in those\nislands already vested should be protected and that there should be\nequality of opportunity for the future. It was further pointed out that\nmembership in the Conference on the part of the United States was qualified\nby the consideration that this Government would not become a signatory to\nany conventional arrangement concluded by the European members of the\nConference which would imply contributory participation by the United\nStates in any obligation or responsibility for the enforcement of any\nscheme of administration which might be devised by the Conference for the\nislands.</p>\n\n<p>THE NEAR EAST.</p>\n\n<p>His Majesty Mehmed V, Sultan of Turkey, recently sent to this country a\nspecial embassy to announce his accession. The quick transition of the\nGovernment of the Ottoman Empire from one of retrograde tendencies to a\nconstitutional government with a Parliament and with progressive modern\npolicies of reform and public improvement is one of the important phenomena\nof our times. Constitutional government seems also to have made further\nadvance in Persia. These events have turned the eyes of the world upon the\nNear East. In that quarter the prestige of the United States has spread\nwidely through the peaceful influence of American schools, universities and\nmissionaries. There is every reason why we should obtain a greater share of\nthe commerce of the Near East since the conditions are more favorable now\nthan ever before.</p>\n\n<p>LATIN AMERICA.</p>\n\n<p>One of the happiest events in recent Pan-American diplomacy was the\npacific, independent settlement by the Governments of Bolivia and Peru of a\nboundary difference between them, which for some weeks threatened to cause\nwar and even to entrain embitterments affecting other republics less\ndirectly concerned. From various quarters, directly or indirectly\nconcerned, the intermediation of the United States was sought to assist in\na solution of the controversy. Desiring at all times to abstain from any\nundue mingling in the affairs of sister republics and having faith in the\nability of the Governments of Peru and Bolivia themselves to settle their\ndifferences in a manner satisfactory to themselves which, viewed with\nmagnanimity, would assuage all embitterment, this Government steadily\nabstained from being drawn into the controversy and was much gratified to\nfind its confidence justified by events.</p>\n\n<p>On the 9th of July next there will open at Buenos Aires the Fourth\nPan-American Conference. This conference will have a special meaning to the\nhearts of all Americans, because around its date are clustered the\nanniversaries of the independence of so many of the American republics. It\nis not necessary for me to remind the Congress of the political, social and\ncommercial importance of these gatherings. You are asked to make liberal\nappropriation for our participation. If this be granted, it is my purpose\nto appoint a distinguished and representative delegation, qualified\nfittingly to represent this country and to deal with the problems of\nintercontinental interest which will there be discussed.</p>\n\n<p>The Argentine Republic will also hold from May to November, 1910, at Buenos\nAires, a great International Agricultural Exhibition in which the United\nStates has been invited to participate. Considering the rapid growth of the\ntrade of the United States with the Argentine Republic and the cordial\nrelations existing between the two nations, together with the fact that it\nprovides an opportunity to show deference to a sister republic on the\noccasion of the celebration of its national independence, the proper\nDepartments of this Government are taking steps to apprise the interests\nconcerned of the opportunity afforded by this Exhibition, in which\nappropriate participation by this country is so desirable. The designation\nof an official representative is also receiving consideration.</p>\n\n<p>To-day, more than ever before, American capital is seeking investment in\nforeign countries, and American products are more and more generally\nseeking foreign markets. As a consequence, in all countries there are\nAmerican citizens and American interests to be protected, on occasion, by\ntheir Government. These movements of men, of capital, and of commodities\nbring peoples and governments closer together and so form bonds of peace\nand mutual dependency, as they must also naturally sometimes make passing\npoints of friction. The resultant situation inevitably imposes upon this\nGovernment vastly increased responsibilities. This Administration, through\nthe Department of State and the foreign service, is lending all proper\nsupport to legitimate and beneficial American enterprises in foreign\ncountries, the degree of such support being measured by the national\nadvantages to be expected. A citizen himself can not by contract or\notherwise divest himself of the right, nor can this Government escape the\nobligation, of his protection in his personal and property rights when\nthese are unjustly infringed in a foreign country. To avoid ceaseless\nvexations it is proper that in considering whether American enterprise\nshould be encouraged or supported in a particular country, the Government\nshould give full weight not only to the national, as opposed to the\nindividual benefits to accrue, but also to the fact whether or not the\nGovernment of the country in question is in its administration and in its\ndiplomacy faithful to the principles of moderation, equity and justice upon\nwhich alone depend international credit, in diplomacy as well as in\nfinance.</p>\n\n<p>The Pan-American policy of this Government has long been fixed in its\nprinciples and remains unchanged. With the changed circumstances of the\nUnited States and of the Republics to the south of us, most of which have\ngreat natural resources, stable government and progressive ideals, the\napprehension which gave rise to the Monroe Doctrine may be said to have\nnearly disappeared, and neither the doctrine as it exists nor any other\ndoctrine of American policy should be permitted to operate for the\nperpetuation of irresponsible government, the escape of just obligations,\nor the insidious allegation of dominating ambitions on the part of the\nUnited States.</p>\n\n<p>Beside the fundamental doctrines of our Pan-American policy there have\ngrown up a realization of political interests, community of institutions\nand ideals, and a flourishing commerce. All these bonds will be greatly\nstrengthened as time goes on and increased facilities, such as the great\nbank soon to be established in Latin America, supply the means for building\nup the colossal intercontinental commerce of the future.</p>\n\n<p>My meeting with President Diaz and the greeting exchanged on both American\nand Mexican soil served, I hope, to signalize the close and cordial\nrelations which so well bind together this Republic and the great Republic\nimmediately to the south, between which there is so vast a network of\nmaterial interests.</p>\n\n<p>I am happy to say that all but one of the cases which for so long vexed our\nrelations with Venezuela have been settled within the past few months and\nthat, under the enlightened regime now directing the Government of\nVenezuela, provision has been made for arbitration of the remaining case\nbefore The Hague Tribunal. On July 30, 1909, the Government of Panama\nagreed, after considerable negotiation, to indemnify the relatives of the\nAmerican officers and sailors who were brutally treated, one of them\nhaving, indeed, been killed by the Panaman police this year.</p>\n\n<p>The sincere desire of the Government of Panama to do away with a situation\nwhere such an accident could occur is manifest in the recent request in\ncompliance with which this Government has lent the services of an officer\nof the Army to be employed by the Government of Panama as Instructor of\nPolice.</p>\n\n<p>The sanitary improvements and public works undertaken in Cuba prior to the\npresent administration of that Government, in the success of which the\nUnited States is interested under the treaty, are reported to be making\ngood progress and since the Congress provided for the continuance of the\nreciprocal commercial arrangement between Cuba and the United States\nassurance has been received that no negotiations injuriously affecting the\nsituation will be undertaken without consultation. The collection of the\ncustoms of the Dominican Republic through the general receiver of customs\nappointed by the President of the United States in accordance with the\nconvention of February 8, 1907, has proceeded in an uneventful and\nsatisfactory manner. The customs receipts have decreased owing to disturbed\npolitical and economic conditions and to a very natural curtailment of\nimports in view of the anticipated revision of the Dominican tariff\nschedule. The payments to the fiscal agency fund for the service of the\nbonded debt of the Republic, as provided by the convention, have been\nregularly and promptly made, and satisfactory progress has been made in\ncarrying out the provisions of the convention looking towards the\ncompletion of the adjustment of the debt and the acquirement by the\nDominican Government of certain concessions and monopolies which have been\na burden to the commerce of the country. In short, the receivership has\ndemonstrated its ability, even under unfavorable economic and political\nconditions, to do the work for which it was intended.</p>\n\n<p>This Government was obliged to intervene diplomatically to bring about\narbitration or settlement of the claim of the Emery Company against\nNicaragua, which it had long before been agreed should be arbitrated. A\nsettlement of this troublesome case was reached by the signature of a\nprotocol on September 18, 1909.</p>\n\n<p>Many years ago diplomatic intervention became necessary to the protection\nof the interests in the American claim of Alsop and Company against the\nGovernment of Chile. The Government of Chile had frequently admitted\nobligation in the case and had promised this Government to settle. There\nhad been two abortive attempts to do so through arbitral commissions, which\nfailed through lack of jurisdiction. Now, happily, as the result of the\nrecent diplomatic negotiations, the Governments of the United States and of\nChile, actuated by the sincere desire to free from any strain those cordial\nand friendly relations upon which both set such store, have agreed by a\nprotocol to submit the controversy to definitive settlement by His\nBritannic Majesty, Edward VII.</p>\n\n<p>Since the Washington Conventions of 1907 were communicated to the\nGovernment of the United States as a consulting and advising party, this\nGovernment has been almost continuously called upon by one or another, and\nin turn by all the five Central American Republics, to exert itself for the\nmaintenance of the Conventions. Nearly every complaint has been against the\nZelaya Government of Nicaragua, which has kept Central America in constant\ntension or turmoil. The responses made to the representations of Central\nAmerican Republics, as due from the United States on account of its\nrelation to the Washington Conventions, have been at all times conservative\nand have avoided, so far as possible, any semblance of interference,\nalthough it is very apparent that the considerations of geographic\nproximity to the Canal Zone and of the very substantial American interests\nin Central America give to the United States a special position in the zone\nof these Republics and the Caribbean Sea.</p>\n\n<p>I need not rehearse here the patient efforts of this Government to promote\npeace and welfare among these Republics, efforts which are fully\nappreciated by the majority of them who are loyal to their true interests.\nIt would be no less unnecessary to rehearse here the sad tale of\nunspeakable barbarities and oppression alleged to have been committed by\nthe Zelaya Government. Recently two Americans were put to death by order of\nPresident Zelaya himself. They were reported to have been regularly\ncommissioned officers in the organized forces of a revolution which had\ncontinued many weeks and was in control of about half of the Republic, and\nas such, according to the modern enlightened practice of civilized nations,\nthey were entitled to be dealt with as prisoners of war.</p>\n\n<p>At the date when this message is printed this Government has terminated\ndiplomatic relations with the Zelaya Government, for reasons made public in\na communication to the former Nicaraguan charge d\'affaires, and is\nintending to take such future steps as may be found most consistent with\nits dignity, its duty to American interests, and its moral obligations to\nCentral America and to civilization. It may later be necessary for me to\nbring this subject to the attention of the Congress in a special message.</p>\n\n<p>The International Bureau of American Republics has carried on an important\nand increasing work during the last year. In the exercise of its peculiar\nfunctions as an international agency, maintained by all the American\nRepublics for the development of Pan-American commerce and friendship, it\nhas accomplished a great practical good which could be done in the same way\nby no individual department or bureau of one government, and is therefore\ndeserving of your liberal support. The fact that it is about to enter a new\nbuilding, erected through the munificence of an American philanthropist and\nthe contributions of all the American nations, where both its efficiency of\nadministration and expense of maintenance will naturally be much augmented,\nfurther entitles it to special consideration.</p>\n\n<p>THE FAR EAST.</p>\n\n<p>In the Far East this Government preserves unchanged its policy of\nsupporting the principle of equality of opportunity and scrupulous respect\nfor the integrity of the Chinese Empire, to which policy are pledged the\ninterested Powers of both East and West.</p>\n\n<p>By the Treaty of 1903 China has undertaken the abolition of likin with a\nmoderate and proportionate raising of the customs tariff along with\ncurrency reform. These reforms being of manifest advantage to foreign\ncommerce as well as to the interests of China, this Government is\nendeavoring to facilitate these measures and the needful acquiescence of\nthe treaty Powers. When it appeared that Chinese likin revenues were to be\nhypothecated to foreign bankers in connection with a great railway project,\nit was obvious that the Governments whose nationals held this loan would\nhave a certain direct interest in the question of the carrying out by China\nof the reforms in question. Because this railroad loan represented a\npractical and real application of the open door policy through cooperation\nwith China by interested Powers as well as because of its relations to the\nreforms referred to above, the Administration deemed American participation\nto be of great national interest. Happily, when it was as a matter of broad\npolicy urgent that this opportunity should not be lost, the indispensable\ninstrumentality presented itself when a group of American bankers, of\ninternational reputation and great resources, agreed at once to share in\nthe loan upon precisely such terms as this Government should approve. The\nchief of those terms was that American railway material should be upon an\nexact equality with that of the other nationals joining in the loan in the\nplacing of orders for this whole railroad system. After months of\nnegotiation the equal participation of Americans seems at last assured. It\nis gratifying that Americans will thus take their share in this extension\nof these great highways of trade, and to believe that such activities will\ngive a real impetus to our commerce and will prove a practical corollary to\nour historic policy in the Far East.</p>\n\n<p>The Imperial Chinese Government in pursuance of its decision to devote\nfunds from the portion of the indemnity remitted by the United States to\nthe sending of students to this country has already completed arrangements\nfor carrying out this purpose, and a considerable body of students have\narrived to take up their work in our schools and universities. No one can\ndoubt the happy effect that the associations formed by these representative\nyoung men will have when they return to take up their work in the\nprogressive development of their country.</p>\n\n<p>The results of the Opium Conference held at Shanghai last spring at the\ninvitation of the United States have been laid before the Government. The\nreport shows that China is making remarkable progress and admirable efforts\ntoward the eradication of the opium evil and that the Governments concerned\nhave not allowed their commercial interests to interfere with a helpful\ncooperation in this reform. Collateral investigations of the opium question\nin this country lead me to recommend that the manufacture, sale and use of\nopium and its derivatives in the United States should be so far as possible\nmore rigorously controlled by legislation.</p>\n\n<p>In one of the Chinese-Japanese Conventions of September 4 of this year\nthere was a provision which caused considerable public apprehension in that\nupon its face it was believed in some quarters to seek to establish a\nmonopoly of mining privileges along the South Manchurian and Antung-Mukden\nRailroads, and thus to exclude Americans from a wide field of enterprise,\nto take part in which they were by treaty with China entitled. After a\nthorough examination of the Conventions and of the several contextual\ndocuments, the Secretary of State reached the conclusion that no such\nmonopoly was intended or accomplished. However, in view of the widespread\ndiscussion of this question, to confirm the view it had reached, this\nGovernment made inquiry of the Imperial Chinese and Japanese Governments\nand received from each official assurance that the provision had no purpose\ninconsistent with the policy of equality of opportunity to which the\nsignatories, in common with the United States, are pledged.</p>\n\n<p>Our traditional relations with the Japanese Empire continue cordial as\nusual. As the representative of Japan, His Imperial Highness Prince Kuni\nvisited the Hudson-Fulton Celebration. The recent visit of a delegation of\nprominent business men as guests of the chambers of commerce of the Pacific\nslope, whose representatives had been so agreeably received in Japan, will\ndoubtless contribute to the growing trade across the Pacific, as well as to\nthat mutual understanding which leads to mutual appreciation. The\narrangement of 1908 for a cooperative control of the coming of laborers to\nthe United States has proved to work satisfactorily. The matter of a\nrevision of the existing treaty between the United States and Japan which\nis terminable in 1912 is already receiving the study of both countries.</p>\n\n<p>The Department of State is considering the revision in whole or in part, of\nthe existing treaty with Siam, which was concluded in 1856, and is now, in\nrespect to many of its provisions, out of date.</p>\n\n<p>THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE.</p>\n\n<p>I earnestly recommend to the favorable action of the Congress the estimates\nsubmitted by the Department of State and most especially the legislation\nsuggested in the Secretary of State\'s letter of this date whereby it will\nbe possible to develop and make permanent the reorganization of the\nDepartment upon modern lines in a manner to make it a thoroughly efficient\ninstrument in the furtherance of our foreign trade and of American\ninterests abroad. The plan to have Divisions of Latin-American and Far\nEastern Affairs and to institute a certain specialization in business with\nEurope and the Near East will at once commend itself. These\npolitico-geographical divisions and the detail from the diplomatic or\nconsular service to the Department of a number of men, who bring to the\nstudy of complicated problems in different parts of the world practical\nknowledge recently gained on the spot, clearly is of the greatest advantage\nto the Secretary of State in foreseeing conditions likely to arise and in\nconducting the great variety of correspondence and negotiation. It should\nbe remembered that such facilities exist in the foreign offices of all the\nleading commercial nations and that to deny them to the Secretary of State\nwould be to place this Government at a great disadvantage in the rivalry of\ncommercial competition.</p>\n\n<p>The consular service has been greatly improved under the law of April 5,\n1906, and the Executive Order of June 27, 1906, and I commend to your\nconsideration the question of embodying in a statute the principles of the\npresent Executive Order upon which the efficiency of our consular service\nis wholly dependent.</p>\n\n<p>In modern times political and commercial interests are interrelated, and in\nthe negotiation of commercial treaties, conventions and tariff agreements,\nthe keeping open of opportunities and the proper support of American\nenterprises, our diplomatic service is quite as important as the consular\nservice to the business interests of the country. Impressed with this idea\nand convinced that selection after rigorous examination, promotion for\nmerit solely and the experience only to be gained through the continuity of\nan organized service are indispensable to a high degree of efficiency in\nthe diplomatic service, I have signed an Executive Order as the first step\ntoward this very desirable result. Its effect should be to place all\nsecretaries in the diplomatic service in much the same position as consular\nofficers are now placed and to tend to the promotion of the most efficient\nto the grade of minister, generally leaving for outside appointments such\nposts of the grade of ambassador or minister as it may be expedient to fill\nfrom without the service. It is proposed also to continue the practice\ninstituted last summer of giving to all newly appointed secretaries at\nleast one month\'s thorough training in the Department of State before they\nproceed to their posts. This has been done for some time in regard to the\nconsular service with excellent results.</p>\n\n<p>Under a provision of the Act of August 5, 1909, I have appointed three\nofficials to assist the officers of the Government in collecting\ninformation necessary to a wise administration of the tariff act of August\n5, 1909. As to questions of customs administration they are cooperating\nwith the officials of the Treasury Department and as to matters of the\nneeds and the exigencies of our manufacturers and exporters, with the\nDepartment of Commerce and Labor, in its relation to the domestic aspect of\nthe subject of foreign commerce. In the study of foreign tariff treatment\nthey will assist the Bureau of Trade Relations of the Department of State.\nIt is hoped thus to coordinate and bring to bear upon this most important\nsubject all the agencies of the Government which can contribute anything to\nits efficient handling.</p>\n\n<p>As a consequence of Section 2 of the tariff act of August 5, 1909, it\nbecomes the duty of the Secretary of State to conduct as diplomatic\nbusiness all the negotiations necessary to place him in a position to\nadvise me as to whether or not a particular country unduly discriminates\nagainst the United States in the sense of the statute referred to. The\ngreat scope and complexity of this work, as well as the obligation to lend\nall proper aid to our expanding commerce, is met by the expansion of the\nBureau of Trade Relations as set forth in the estimates for the Department\nof State.</p>\n\n<p>OTHER DEPARTMENTS.</p>\n\n<p>I have thus in some detail described the important transactions of the\nState Department since the beginning of this Administration for the reason\nthat there is no provision either by statute or custom for a formal report\nby the Secretary of State to the President or to Congress, and a\nPresidential message is the only means by which the condition of our\nforeign relations is brought to the attention of Congress and the public.</p>\n\n<p>In dealing with the affairs of the other Departments, the heads of which\nall submit annual reports, I shall touch only those matters that seem to me\nto call for special mention on my part without minimizing in any way the\nrecommendations made by them for legislation affecting their respective\nDepartments, in all of which I wish to express my general concurrence.</p>\n\n<p>GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES AND REVENUES.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most important question presented to this Administration is\nthat of economy in expenditures and sufficiency of revenue. The deficit of\nthe last fiscal year, and the certain deficit of the current year, prompted\nCongress to throw a greater responsibility on the Executive and the\nSecretary of the Treasury than had heretofore been declared by statute.\nThis declaration imposes upon the Secretary of the Treasury the duty of\nassembling all the estimates of the Executive Departments, bureaus, and\noffices, of the expenditures necessary in the ensuing fiscal year, and of\nmaking an estimate of the revenues of the Government for the same period;\nand if a probable deficit is thus shown, it is made the duty of the\nPresident to recommend the method by which such deficit can be met.</p>\n\n<p>The report of the Secretary shows that the ordinary expenditures for the\ncurrent fiscal year ending June 30, 1910, will exceed the estimated\nreceipts by $34,075,620. If to this deficit is added the sum to be\ndisbursed for the Panama Canal, amounting to $38,000,000, and $1,000,000 to\nbe paid on the public debt, the deficit of ordinary receipts and\nexpenditures will be increased to a total deficit of $73,075,620. This\ndeficit the Secretary proposes to meet by the proceeds of bonds issued to\npay the cost of constructing the Panama Canal. I approve this proposal.</p>\n\n<p>The policy of paying for the construction of the Panama Canal, not out of\ncurrent revenue, but by bond issues, was adopted in the Spooner Act of\n1902, and there seems to be no good reason for departing from the principle\nby which a part at least of the burden of the cost of the canal shall fall\nupon our posterity who are to enjoy it; and there is all the more reason\nfor this view because the actual cost to date of the canal, which is now\nhalf done and which will be completed January 1, 1915, shows that the cost\nof engineering and construction will be $297,766,000, instead of\n$139,705,200, as originally estimated. In addition to engineering and\nconstruction, the other expenses, including sanitation and government, and\nthe amount paid for the properties, the franchise, and the privilege of\nbuilding the canal, increase the cost by $75,435,000, to a total of\n$375,201,000. The increase in the cost of engineering and construction is\ndue to a substantial enlargement of the plan of construction by widening\nthe canal 100 feet in the Culebra cut and by increasing the dimensions of\nthe locks, to the underestimate of the quantity of the work to be done\nunder the original plan, and to an underestimate of the cost of labor and\nmaterials both of which have greatly enhanced in price since the original\nestimate was made.</p>\n\n<p>In order to avoid a deficit for the ensuing fiscal year, I directed the\nheads of Departments in the preparation of their estimates to make them as\nlow as possible consistent with imperative governmental necessity. The\nresult has been, as I am advised by the Secretary of the Treasury, that the\nestimates for the expenses of the Government for the next fiscal year\nending June 30, 1911, are less than the appropriations for this current\nfiscal year by $42,818,000. So far as the Secretary of the Treasury is able\nto form a judgment as to future income, and compare it with the\nexpenditures for the next fiscal year ending June 30, 1911, and excluding\npayments on account of the Panama Canal, which will doubtless be taken up\nby bonds, there will be a surplus of $35,931,000.</p>\n\n<p>In the present estimates the needs of the Departments and of the Government\nhave been cut to the quick, so to speak, and any assumption on the part of\nCongress, so often made in times past, that the estimates have been\nprepared with the expectation that they may be reduced, will result in\nseriously hampering proper administration.</p>\n\n<p>The Secretary of the Treasury points out what should be carefully noted in\nrespect to this reduction in governmental expenses for the next fiscal\nyear, that the economies are of two kinds--first, there is a saving in the\npermanent administration of the Departments, bureaus, and offices of the\nGovernment; and, second, there is a present reduction in expenses by a\npostponement of projects and improvements that ultimately will have to be\ncarried out but which are now delayed with the hope that additional revenue\nin the future will permit their execution without producing a deficit.</p>\n\n<p>It has been impossible in the preparation of estimates greatly to reduce\nthe cost of permanent administration. This can not be done without a\nthorough reorganization of bureaus, offices, and departments. For the\npurpose of securing information which may enable the executive and the\nlegislative branches to unite in a plan for the permanent reduction of the\ncost of governmental administration, the Treasury Department has instituted\nan investigation by one of the most skilled expert accountants in the\nUnited States. The result of his work in two or three bureaus, which, if\nextended to the entire Government, must occupy two or more years, has been\nto show much room for improvement and opportunity for substantial\nreductions in the cost and increased efficiency of administration. The\nobject of the investigation is to devise means to increase the average\nefficiency of each employee. There is great room for improvement toward\nthis end, not only by the reorganization of bureaus and departments and in\nthe avoidance of duplication, but also in the treatment of the individual\nemployee.</p>\n\n<p>Under the present system it constantly happens that two employees receive\nthe same salary when the work of one is far more difficult and important\nand exacting than that of the other. Superior ability is not rewarded or\nencouraged. As the classification is now entirely by salary, an employee\noften rises to the highest class while doing the easiest work, for which\nalone he may be fitted. An investigation ordered by my predecessor resulted\nin the recommendation that the civil service he reclassified according to\nthe kind of work, so that the work requiring most application and knowledge\nand ability shall receive most compensation. I believe such a change would\nbe fairer to the whole force and would permanently improve the personnel of\nthe service.</p>\n\n<p>More than this, every reform directed toward the improvement in the average\nefficiency of government employees must depend on the ability of the\nExecutive to eliminate from the government service those who are\ninefficient from any cause, and as the degree of efficiency in all the\nDepartments is much lessened by the retention of old employees who have\noutlived their energy and usefulness, it is indispensable to any proper\nsystem of economy that provision be made so that their separation from the\nservice shall be easy and inevitable. It is impossible to make such\nprovision unless there is adopted a plan of civil pensions. Most of the\ngreat industrial organizations, and many of the well-conducted railways of\nthis country, are coming to the conclusion that a system of pensions for\nold employees, and the substitution therefor of younger and more energetic\nservants, promotes both economy and efficiency of administration.</p>\n\n<p>I am aware that there is a strong feeling in both Houses of Congress, and\npossibly in the country, against the establishment of civil pensions, and\nthat this has naturally grown out of the heavy burden of military pensions,\nwhich it has always been the policy of our Government to assume; but I am\nstrongly convinced that no other practical solution of the difficulties\npresented by the superannuation of civil servants can be found than that of\na system of civil pensions.</p>\n\n<p>The business and expenditures of the Government have expanded enormously\nsince the Spanish war, but as the revenues have increased in nearly the\nsame proportion as the expenditures until recently, the attention of the\npublic, and of those responsible for the Government, has not been fastened\nupon the question of reducing the cost of administration. We can not, in\nview of the advancing prices of living, hope to save money by a reduction\nin the standard of salaries paid. Indeed, if any change is made in that\nregard, an increase rather than a decrease will be necessary; and the only\nmeans of economy will be in reducing the number of employees and in\nobtaining a greater average of efficiency from those retained in the\nservice.</p>\n\n<p>Close investigation and study needed to make definite recommendations in\nthis regard will consume at least two years. I note with much satisfaction\nthe organization in the Senate of a Committee on Public Expenditures,\ncharged with the duty of conducting such an investigation, and I tender to\nthat committee all the assistance which the executive branch of the\nGovernment can possibly render.</p>\n\n<p>FRAUDS IN THE COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS.</p>\n\n<p>I regret to refer to the fact of the discovery of extensive frauds in the\ncollections of the customs revenue at New York City, in which a number of\nthe subordinate employees in the weighing and other departments were\ndirectly concerned, and in which the beneficiaries were the American Sugar\nRefining Company and others. The frauds consisted in the payment of duty on\nunderweights of sugar. The Government has recovered from the American Sugar\nRefining Company all that it is shown to have been defrauded of. The sum\nwas received in full of the amount due, which might have been recovered by\ncivil suit against the beneficiary of the fraud, but there was an express\nreservation in the contract of settlement by which the settlement should\nnot interfere with, or prevent the criminal prosecution of everyone who was\nfound to be subject to the same.</p>\n\n<p>Criminal prosecutions are now proceeding against a number of the Government\nofficers. The Treasury Department and the Department of Justice are\nexerting every effort to discover all the wrongdoers, including the\nofficers and employees of the companies who may have been privy to the\nfraud. It would seem to me that an investigation of the frauds by Congress\nat present, pending the probing by the Treasury Department and the\nDepartment of Justice, as proposed, might by giving immunity and otherwise\nprove an embarrassment in securing conviction of the guilty parties.</p>\n\n<p>MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM CLAUSE IN TARIFF ACT.</p>\n\n<p>Two features of the new tariff act call for special reference. By virtue of\nthe clause known as the "Maximum and Minimum" clause, it is the duty of the\nExecutive to consider the laws and practices of other countries with\nreference to the importation into those countries of the products and\nmerchandise of the United States, and if the Executive finds such laws and\npractices not to be unduly discriminatory against the United States, the\nminimum duties provided in the bill are to go into force.</p>\n\n<p>Unless the President makes such a finding, then the maximum duties provided\nin the bill, that is, an increase of twenty-five per cent. ad valorem over\nthe minimum duties, are to be in force. Fear has been expressed that this\npower conferred and duty imposed on the Executive is likely to lead to a\ntariff war. I beg to express the hope and belief that no such result need\nbe anticipated.</p>\n\n<p>The discretion granted to the Executive by the terms "unduly\ndiscriminatory" is wide. In order that the maximum duty shall be charged\nagainst the imports from a country, it is necessary that he shall find on\nthe part of that country not only discriminations in its laws or the\npractice under them against the trade of the United States, but that the\ndiscriminations found shall be undue; that is, without good and fair\nreason. I conceive that this power was reposed in the President with the\nhope that the maximum duties might never be applied in any case, but that\nthe power to apply them would enable the President and the State Department\nthrough friendly negotiation to secure the elimination from the laws and\nthe practice under them of any foreign country of that which is unduly\ndiscriminatory. No one is seeking a tariff war or a condition in which the\nspirit of retaliation shall be aroused.</p>\n\n<p>USES OF THE NEW TARIFF BOARD.</p>\n\n<p>The new tariff law enables me to appoint a tariff board to assist me in\nconnection with the Department of State in the administration of the\nminimum and maximum clause of the act and also to assist officers of the\nGovernment in the administration of the entire law. An examination of the\nlaw and an understanding of the nature of the facts which should be\nconsidered in discharging the functions imposed upon the Executive show\nthat I have the power to direct the tariff board to make a comprehensive\nglossary and encyclopedia of the terms used and articles embraced in the\ntariff law, and to secure information as to the cost of production of such\ngoods in this country and the cost of their production in foreign\ncountries. I have therefore appointed a tariff board consisting of three\nmembers and have directed them to perform all the duties above described.\nThis work will perhaps take two or three years, and I ask from Congress a\ncontinuing annual appropriation equal to that already made for its\nprosecution. I believe that the work of this board will be of prime utility\nand importance whenever Congress shall deem it wise again to readjust the\ncustoms duties. If the facts secured by the tariff board are of such a\ncharacter as to show generally that the rates of duties imposed by the\npresent tariff law are excessive under the principles of protection as\ndescribed in the platform of the successful party at the late election, I\nshall not hesitate to invite the attention of Congress to this fact and to\nthe necessity for action predicated thereon. Nothing, however, halts\nbusiness and interferes with the course of prosperity so much as the\nthreatened revision of the tariff, and until the facts are at hand, after\ncareful and deliberate investigation, upon which such revision can properly\nbe undertaken, it seems to me unwise to attempt it. The amount of\nmisinformation that creeps into arguments pro and con in respect to tariff\nrates is such as to require the kind of investigation that I have directed\nthe tariff board to make, an investigation undertaken by it wholly without\nrespect to the effect which the facts may have in calling for a\nreadjustment of the rates of duty.</p>\n\n<p>WAR DEPARTMENT.</p>\n\n<p>In the interest of immediate economy and because of the prospect of a\ndeficit, I have required a reduction in the estimates of the War Department\nfor the coming fiscal year, which brings the total estimates down to an\namount forty-five millions less than the corresponding estimates for last\nyear. This could only be accomplished by cutting off new projects and\nsuspending for the period of one year all progress in military matters. For\nthe same reason I have directed that the Army shall not be recruited up to\nits present authorized strength. These measures can hardly be more than\ntemporary--to last until our revenues are in better condition and until the\nwhole question of the expediency of adopting a definite military policy can\nbe submitted to Congress, for I am sure that the interests of the military\nestablishment are seriously in need of careful consideration by Congress.\nThe laws regulating the organization of our armed forces in the event of\nwar need to be revised in order that the organization can be modified so as\nto produce a force which would be more consistently apportioned throughout\nits numerous branches. To explain the circumstances upon which this opinion\nis based would necessitate a lengthy discussion, and I postpone it until\nthe first convenient opportunity shall arise to send to Congress a special\nmessage upon this subject.</p>\n\n<p>The Secretary of War calls attention to a number of needed changes in the\nArmy in all of which I concur, but the point upon which I place most\nemphasis is the need for an elimination bill providing a method by which\nthe merits of officers shall have some effect upon their advancement and by\nwhich the advancement of all may be accelerated by the effective\nelimination of a definite proportion of the least efficient. There are in\nevery army, and certainly in ours, a number of officers who do not violate\ntheir duty in any such way as to give reason for a court-martial or\ndismissal, but who do not show such aptitude and skill and character for\nhigh command as to justify their remaining in the active service to be\nPromoted. Provision should be made by which they may be retired on a\ncertain proportion of their pay, increasing with their length of service at\nthe time of retirement. There is now a personnel law for the Navy which\nitself needs amendment and to which I shall make further reference. Such a\nlaw is needed quite as much for the Army.</p>\n\n<p>The coast defenses of the United States proper are generally all that could\nbe desired, and in some respects they are rather more elaborate than under\npresent conditions are needed to stop an enemy\'s fleet from entering the\nharbors defended. There is, however, one place where additional defense is\nbadly needed, and that is at the mouth of Chesapeake Bay, where it is\nproposed to make an artificial island for a fort which shall prevent an\nenemy\'s fleet from entering this most important strategical base of\noperations on the whole Atlantic and Gulf coasts. I hope that appropriate\nlegislation will be adopted to secure the construction of this defense.</p>\n\n<p>The military and naval joint board have unanimously agreed that it would be\nunwise to make the large expenditures which at one time were contemplated\nin the establishment of a naval base and station in the Philippine Islands,\nand have expressed their judgment, in which I fully concur, in favor of\nmaking an extensive naval base at Pearl Harbor, near Honolulu, and not in\nthe Philippines. This does not dispense with the necessity for the\ncomparatively small appropriations required to finish the proper coast\ndefenses in the Philippines now under construction on the island of\nCorregidor and elsewhere or to complete a suitable repair station and\ncoaling supply station at Olongapo, where is the floating dock "Dewey." I\nhope that this recommendation of the joint board will end the discussion as\nto the comparative merits of Manila Bay and Olongapo as naval stations, and\nwill lead to prompt measures for the proper equipment and defense of Pearl\nHarbor.</p>\n\n<p>THE NAVY.</p>\n\n<p>The return of the battle-ship fleet from its voyage around the world, in\nmore efficient condition than when it started, was a noteworthy event of\ninterest alike to our citizens and the naval authorities of the world.\nBesides the beneficial and far-reaching effect on our personal and\ndiplomatic relations in the countries which the fleet visited, the marked\nsuccess of the ships in steaming around the world in all weathers on\nschedule time has increased respect for our Navy and has added to our\nnational prestige.</p>\n\n<p>Our enlisted personnel recruited from all sections of the country is young\nand energetic and representative of the national spirit. It is, moreover,\nowing to its intelligence, capable of quick training into the modern\nman-of-warsman. Our officers are earnest and zealous in their profession,\nbut it is a regrettable fact that the higher officers are old for the\nresponsibilities of the modern navy, and the admirals do not arrive at flag\nrank young enough to obtain adequate training in their duties as flag\nofficers. This need for reform in the Navy has been ably and earnestly\npresented to Congress by my predecessor, and I also urgently recommend the\nsubject for consideration.</p>\n\n<p>Early in the coming session a comprehensive plan for the reorganization of\nthe officers of all corps of the Navy will be presented to Congress, and I\nhope it will meet with action suited to its urgency.</p>\n\n<p>Owing to the necessity for economy in expenditures, I have directed the\ncurtailment of recommendations for naval appropriations so that they are\nthirty-eight millions less than the corresponding estimates of last year,\nand the request for new naval construction is limited to two first-class\nbattle ships and one repair vessel.</p>\n\n<p>The use of a navy is for military purposes, and there has been found need\nin the Department of a military branch dealing directly with the military\nuse of the fleet. The Secretary of the Navy has also felt the lack of\nresponsible advisers to aid him in reaching conclusions and deciding\nimportant matters between coordinate branches of the Department. To secure\nthese results he has inaugurated a tentative plan involving certain changes\nin the organization of the Navy Department, including the navy-yards, all\nof which have been found by the Attorney-General to be in accordance with\nlaw. I have approved the execution of the plan proposed because of the\ngreater efficiency and economy it promises.</p>\n\n<p>The generosity of Congress has provided in the present Naval Observatory\nthe most magnificent and expensive astronomical establishment in the world.\nIt is being used for certain naval purposes which might easily and\nadequately be subserved by a small division connected with the Naval\nDepartment at only a fraction of the cost of the present Naval Observatory.\nThe official Board of Visitors established by Congress and appointed in\n1901 expressed its conclusion that the official head of the observatory\nshould be an eminent astronomer appointed by the President by and with the\nadvice and consent of the Senate, holding his place by a tenure at least as\npermanent as that of the Superintendent of the Coast Survey or the head of\nthe Geological Survey, and not merely by a detail of two or three years\'\nduration. I fully concur in this judgment, and urge a provision by law for\nthe appointment of such a director.</p>\n\n<p>It may not be necessary to take the observatory out of the Navy Department\nand put it into another department in which opportunity for scientific\nresearch afforded by the observatory would seem to be more appropriate,\nthough I believe such a transfer in the long run is the best policy. I am\nsure, however, I express the desire of the astronomers and those learned in\nthe kindred sciences when I urge upon Congress that the Naval Observatory\nbe now dedicated to science under control of a man of science who can, if\nneed be, render all the service to the Navy Department which this\nobservatory now renders, and still furnish to the world the discoveries in\nastronomy that a great astronomer using such a plant would be likely to\nmake.</p>\n\n<p>DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE EXPEDITION IN LEGAL PROCEDURE</p>\n\n<p>The deplorable delays in the administration of civil and criminal law have\nreceived the attention of committees of the American Bar Association and of\nmany State Bar Associations, as well as the considered thought of judges\nand jurists. In my judgment, a change in judicial procedure, with a view to\nreducing its expense to private litigants in civil cases and facilitating\nthe dispatch of business and final decision in both civil and criminal\ncases, constitutes the greatest need in our American institutions. I do not\ndoubt for one moment that much of the lawless violence and cruelty\nexhibited in lynchings is directly due to the uncertainties and injustice\ngrowing out of the delays in trials, judgments, and the executions thereof\nby our courts. Of course these remarks apply quite as well to the\nadministration of justice in State courts as to that in Federal courts, and\nwithout making invidious distinction it is perhaps not too much to say\nthat, speaking generally, the defects are less in the Federal courts than\nin the State courts. But they are very great in the Federal courts. The\nexpedition with which business is disposed of both on the civil and the\ncriminal side of English courts under modern rules of procedure makes the\ndelays in our courts seem archaic and barbarous. The procedure in the\nFederal courts should furnish an example for the State courts. I presume it\nis impossible, without an amendment to the Constitution, to unite under one\nform of action the proceedings at common law and proceedings in equity in\nthe Federal courts, but it is certainly not impossible by a statute to\nsimplify and make short and direct the procedure both at law and in equity\nin those courts. It is not impossible to cut down still more than it is cut\ndown, the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court so as to confine it almost\nwholly to statutory and constitutional questions. Under the present\nstatutes the equity and admiralty procedure in the Federal courts is under\nthe control of the Supreme Court, but in the pressure of business to which\nthat court is subjected, it is impossible to hope that a radical and proper\nreform of the Federal equity procedure can be brought about. I therefore\nrecommend legislation providing for the appointment by the President of a\ncommission with authority to examine the law and equity procedure of the\nFederal courts of first instance, the law of appeals from those courts to\nthe courts of appeals and to the Supreme Court, and the costs imposed in\nsuch procedure upon the private litigants and upon the public treasury and\nmake recommendation with a view to simplifying and expediting the procedure\nas far as possible and making it as inexpensive as may be to the litigant\nof little means.</p>\n\n<p>INJUNCTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE.</p>\n\n<p>The platform of the successful party in the last election contained the\nfollowing: "The Republican party will uphold at all times the authority and\nintegrity of the courts, State and Federal, and will ever insist that their\npowers to enforce their process and to protect life, liberty, and property\nshall be preserved inviolate. We believe, however, that the rules of\nprocedure in the Federal courts with respect to the issuance of the writ of\ninjunction should be more accurately defined by statute, and that no\ninjunction or temporary restraining order should be issued without notice,\nexcept where irreparable injury would result from delay, in which case a\nspeedy hearing thereafter should be granted." I recommend that in\ncompliance with the promise thus made, appropriate legislation be adopted.\nThe ends of justice will best be met and the chief cause of complaint\nagainst ill-considered injunctions without notice will be removed by the\nenactment of a statute forbidding hereafter the issuing of any injunction\nor restraining order, whether temporary or permanent, by any Federal court,\nwithout previous notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard on behalf\nof the parties to be enjoined; unless it shall appear to the satisfaction\nof the court that the delay necessary to give such notice and hearing would\nresult in irreparable injury to the complainant and unless also the court\nshall from the evidence make a written finding, which shall be spread upon\nthe court minutes, that immediate and irreparable injury is likely to ensue\nto the complainant, and shall define the injury, state why it is\nirreparable, and shall also endorse on the order issued the date and the\nhour of the issuance of the order. Moreover, every such injunction or\nrestraining order issued without previous notice and opportunity by the\ndefendant to be heard should by force of the statute expire and be of no\neffect after seven days from the issuance thereof or within any time less\nthan that period which the court may fix, unless within such seven days or\nsuch less period, the injunction or order is extended or renewed after\nprevious notice and opportunity to be heard.</p>\n\n<p>My judgment is that the passage of such an act which really embodies the\nbest practice in equity and is very like the rule now in force in some\ncourts will prevent the issuing of ill-advised orders of injunction without\nnotice and will render such orders when issued much less objectionable by\nthe short time in which they may remain effective.</p>\n\n<p>ANTI-TRUST AND INTERSTATE COMMERCE LAWS.</p>\n\n<p>The jurisdiction of the General Government over interstate commerce has led\nto the passage of the so-called "Sherman Anti-trust Law" and the\n"Interstate Commerce Law" and its amendments. The developments in the\noperation of those laws, as shown by indictments, trials, judicial\ndecisions, and other sources of information, call for a discussion and some\nsuggestions as to amendments. These I prefer to embody in a special message\ninstead of including them in the present communication, and I shall avail\nmyself of the first convenient opportunity to bring these subjects to the\nattention of Congress.</p>\n\n<p>JAIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.</p>\n\n<p>My predecessor transmitted to the Congress a special message on January 11,\n1909, accompanying the report of Commissioners theretofore appointed to\ninvestigate the jail, workhouse, etc., in the District of Columbia, in\nwhich he directed attention to the report as setting forth vividly, "the\nreally outrageous conditions in the workhouse and jail."</p>\n\n<p>The Congress has taken action in pursuance of the recommendations of that\nreport and of the President, to the extent of appropriating funds and\nenacting the necessary legislation for the establishment of a workhouse and\nreformatory. No action, however, has been taken by the Congress with\nrespect to the jail, the conditions of which are still antiquated and\ninsanitary. I earnestly recommend the passage of a sufficient appropriation\nto enable a thorough remodeling of that institution to be made without\ndelay. It is a reproach to the National Government that almost under the\nshadow of the Capitol Dome prisoners should be confined in a building\ndestitute of the ordinary decent appliances requisite to cleanliness and\nsanitary conditions.</p>\n\n<p>POST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT. SECOND-CLASS MAIL MATTER.</p>\n\n<p>The deficit every year in the Post-Office Department is largely caused by\nthe low rate of postage of 1 cent a pound charged on second-class mail\nmatter, which includes not only newspapers, but magazines and miscellaneous\nperiodicals. The actual loss growing out of the transmission of this\nsecond-class mail matter at 1 cent a pound amounts to about $63,000,000 a\nyear. The average cost of the transportation of this matter is more than 9\ncents a pound.</p>\n\n<p>It appears that the average distance over which newspapers are delivered to\ntheir customers is 291 miles, while the average haul of magazines is 1,049,\nand of miscellaneous periodicals 1,128 miles. Thus, the average haul of the\nmagazine is three and one-half times and that of the miscellaneous\nperiodical nearly four times the haul of the daily newspaper, yet all of\nthem pay the same postage rate of 1 cent a pound. The statistics of 1907\nshow that second-class mail matter constituted 63.91 per cent. of the\nweight of all the mail, and yielded only 5.19 per cent. of the revenue.</p>\n\n<p>The figures given are startling, and show the payment by the Government of\nan enormous subsidy to the newspapers, magazines, and periodicals, and\nCongress may well consider whether radical steps should not be taken to\nreduce the deficit in the Post-Office Department caused by this discrepancy\nbetween the actual cost of transportation and the compensation exacted\ntherefor.</p>\n\n<p>A great saving might be made, amounting to much more than half of the loss,\nby imposing upon magazines and periodicals a higher rate of postage. They\nare much heavier than newspapers, and contain a much higher proportion of\nadvertising to reading matter, and the average distance of their\ntransportation is three and a half times as great.</p>\n\n<p>The total deficit for the last fiscal year in the Post-Office Department\namounted to $17,500,000. The branches of its business which it did at a\nloss were the second-class mail service, in which the loss, as already\nsaid, was $63,000,000, and the free rural delivery, in which the loss was\n$28,000,000. These losses were in part offset by the profits of the letter\npostage and other sources of income. It would seem wise to reduce the loss\nupon second-class mail matter, at least to the extent of preventing a\ndeficit in the total operations of the Post-Office.</p>\n\n<p>I commend the whole subject to Congress, not unmindful of the spread of\nintelligence which a low charge for carrying newspapers and periodicals\nassists. I very much doubt, however, the wisdom of a policy which\nconstitutes so large a subsidy and requires additional taxation to meet\nit.</p>\n\n<p>POSTAL SAVINGS BANKS.</p>\n\n<p>The second subject worthy of mention in the Post-Office Department is the\nreal necessity and entire practicability of establishing postal savings\nbanks. The successful party at the last election declared in favor of\npostal savings banks, and although the proposition finds opponents in many\nparts of the country, I am convinced that the people desire such banks, and\nam sure that when the banks are furnished they will be productive of the\nutmost good. The postal savings banks are not constituted for the purpose\nof creating competition with other banks. The rate of interest upon\ndeposits to which they would be limited would be so small as to prevent\ntheir drawing deposits away from other banks.</p>\n\n<p>I believe them to be necessary in order to offer a proper inducement to\nthrift and saving to a great many people of small means who do not now have\nbanking facilities, and to whom such a system would offer an opportunity\nfor the accumulation of capital. They will furnish a satisfactory\nsubstitute, based on sound principle and actual successful trial in nearly\nall the countries of the world, for the system of government guaranty of\ndeposits now being adopted in several western States, which with deference\nto those who advocate it seems to me to have in it the seeds of\ndemoralization to conservative banking and certain financial disaster. The\nquestion of how the money deposited in postal savings banks shall be\ninvested is not free from difficulty, but I believe that a satisfactory\nprovision for this purpose was inserted as an amendment to the bill\nconsidered by the Senate at its last session. It has been proposed to delay\nthe consideration of legislation establishing a postal savings bank until\nafter the report of the Monetary Commission. This report is likely to be\ndelayed, and properly so, cause of the necessity for careful deliberation\nand close investigation. I do not see why the one should be tied up with\nthe other. It is understood that the Monetary Commission have looked into\nthe systems of banking which now prevail abroad, and have found that by a\ncontrol there exercised in respect to reserves and the rates of exchange by\nsome central authority panics are avoided. It is not apparent that a system\nof postal savings banks would in any way interfere with a change to such a\nsystem here. Certainly in most of the countries of Europe where control is\nthus exercised by a central authority, postal savings banks exist and are\nnot thought to be inconsistent with a proper financial and banking system.</p>\n\n<p>SHIP SUBSIDY.</p>\n\n<p>Following the course of my distinguished predecessor, I earnestly recommend\nto Congress the consideration and passage of a ship subsidy bill, looking\nto the establishment of lines between our Atlantic seaboard and the eastern\ncoast of South America, as well as lines from the west coast of the United\nStates to South America. China, Japan, and the Philippines. The profits on\nforeign mails are perhaps a sufficient measure of the expenditures which\nmight first be tentatively applied to this method of inducing American\ncapital to undertake the establishment of American lines of steamships in\nthose directions in which we now feel it most important that we should have\nmeans of transportation controlled in the interest of the expansion of our\ntrade. A bill of this character has once passed the House and more than\nonce passed the Senate, and I hope that at this session a bill framed on\nthe same lines and with the same purposes may become a law.</p>\n\n<p>INTERIOR DEPARTMENT. NEW MEXICO AND ARIZONA.</p>\n\n<p>The successful party in the last election in its national platform declared\nin favor of the admission as separate States of New Mexico and Arizona, and\nI recommend that legislation appropriate to this end be adopted. I urge,\nhowever, that care be exercised in the preparation of the legislation\naffecting each Territory to secure deliberation in the selection of persons\nas members of the convention to draft a constitution for the incoming\nState, and I earnestly advise that such constitution after adoption by the\nconvention shall be submitted to the people of the Territory for their\napproval at an election in which the sole issue shall be the merits of the\nproposed constitution, and if the constitution is defeated by popular vote\nmeans shall be provided in the enabling act for a new convention and the\ndrafting of a new constitution. I think it vital that the issue as to the\nmerits of the constitution should not be mixed up with the selection of\nState officers, and that no election of State officers should be had until\nafter the constitution has been fully approved and finally settled upon.\nALASKA.</p>\n\n<p>With respect to the Territory of Alaska, I recommend legislation which\nshall provide for the appointment by the President of a governor and also\nof an executive council, the members of which shall during their term of\noffice reside in the Territory, and which shall have legislative powers\nsufficient to enable it to give to the Territory local laws adapted to its\npresent growth. I strongly deprecate legislation looking to the election of\na Territorial legislature in that vast district. The lack of permanence of\nresidence of a large part of the present population and the small number of\nthe people who either permanently or temporarily reside in the district as\ncompared with its vast expanse and the variety of the interests that have\nto be subserved, make it altogether unfitting in my judgment to provide for\na popular election of a legislative body. The present system is not\nadequate and does not furnish the character of local control that ought to\nbe there. The only compromise it seems to me which may give needed local\nlegislation and secure a conservative government is the one I propose.</p>\n\n<p>CONSERVATION OF NATIONAL RESOURCES.</p>\n\n<p>In several Departments there is presented the necessity for legislation\nlooking to the further conservation of our national resources, and the\nsubject is one of such importance as to require a more detailed and\nextended discussion than can be entered upon in this communication. For\nthat reason I shall take an early opportunity to send a special message to\nCongress on the subject of the improvement of our waterways, upon the\nreclamation and irrigation of arid, semiarid, and swamp lands; upon the\npreservation of our forests and the reforesting of suitable areas; upon the\nreclassification of the public domain with a view of separating from\nagricultural settlement mineral, coal, and phosphate lands and sites\nbelonging to the Government bordering on streams suitable for the\nutilization of water power.</p>\n\n<p>DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.</p>\n\n<p>I commend to your careful consideration the report of the Secretary of\nAgriculture as showing the immense sphere of usefulness which that\nDepartment now fills and the wonderful addition to the wealth of the nation\nmade by the farmers of this country in the crops of the current year.</p>\n\n<p>DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND LABOR. THE LIGHT-HOUSE BOARD.</p>\n\n<p>The Light-House Board now discharges its duties under the Department of\nCommerce and Labor. For upwards of forty years this Board has been\nconstituted of military and naval officers and two or three men of science,\nwith such an absence of a duly constituted executive head that it is\nmarvelous what work has been accomplished. In the period of construction\nthe energy and enthusiasm of all the members prevented the inherent defects\nof the system from interfering greatly with the beneficial work of the\nBoard, but now that the work is chiefly confined to maintenance and repair,\nfor which purpose the country is divided into sixteen districts, to which\nare assigned an engineer officer of the Army and an inspector of the Navy,\neach with a light-house tender and the needed plant for his work, it has\nbecome apparent by the frequent friction that arises, due to the absence of\nany central independent authority, that there must be a complete\nreorganization of the Board. I concede the advantage of keeping in the\nsystem the rigidity of discipline that the presence of naval and military\nofficers in charge insures, but unless the presence of such officers in the\nBoard can be made consistent with a responsible executive head that shall\nhave proper authority, I recommend the transfer of control over the\nlight-houses to a suitable civilian bureau. This is in accordance with the\njudgment of competent persons who are familiar with the workings of the\npresent system. I am confident that a reorganization can be effected which\nshall avoid the recurrence of friction between members, instances of which\nhave been officially brought to my attention, and that by such\nreorganization greater efficiency and a substantial reduction in the\nexpense of operation can be brought about.</p>\n\n<p>CONSOLIDATION OF BUREAUS.</p>\n\n<p>I request Congressional authority to enable the Secretary of Commerce and\nLabor to unite the Bureaus of Manufactures and Statistics. This was\nrecommended by a competent committee appointed in the previous\nadministration for the purpose of suggesting changes in the interest of\neconomy and efficiency, and is requested by the Secretary.</p>\n\n<p>THE WHITE SLAVE TRADE.</p>\n\n<p>I greatly regret to have to say that the investigations made in the Bureau\nof Immigration and other sources of information lead to the view that there\nis urgent necessity for additional legislation and greater executive\nactivity to suppress the recruiting of the ranks of prostitutes from the\nstreams of immigration into this country--an evil which, for want of a\nbetter name, has been called "The White Slave Trade." I believe it to be\nconstitutional to forbid, under penalty, the transportation of persons for\npurposes of prostitution across national and state lines; and by\nappropriating a fund of $50,000 to be used by the Secretary of Commerce and\nLabor for the employment of special inspectors it will be possible to bring\nthose responsible for this trade to indictment and conviction under a\nfederal law.</p>\n\n<p>BUREAU OF HEALTH</p>\n\n<p>For a very considerable period a movement has been gathering strength,\nespecially among the members of the medical profession, in favor of a\nconcentration of the instruments of the National Government which have to\ndo with the promotion of public health. In the nature of things, the\nMedical Department of the Army and the Medical Department of the Navy must\nbe kept separate. But there seems to be no reason why all the other bureaus\nand offices in the General Government which have to do with the public\nhealth or subjects akin thereto should not be united in a bureau to be\ncalled the "Bureau of Public Health." This would necessitate the transfer\nof the Marine-Hospital Service to such a bureau. I am aware that there is\nwide field in respect to the public health committed to the States in which\nthe Federal Government can not exercise jurisdiction, but we have seen in\nthe Agricultural Department the expansion into widest usefulness of a\ndepartment giving attention to agriculture when that subject is plainly one\nover which the States properly exercise direct jurisdiction. The\nopportunities offered for useful research and the spread of useful\ninformation in regard to the cultivation of the soil and the breeding of\nstock and the solution of many of the intricate problems in progressive\nagriculture have demonstrated the wisdom of establishing that department.\nSimilar reasons, of equal force, can be given for the establishment of a\nbureau of health that shall not only exercise the police jurisdiction of\nthe Federal Government respecting quarantine, but which shall also afford\nan opportunity for investigation and research by competent experts into\nquestions of health affecting the whole country, or important sections\nthereof, questions which, in the absence of Federal governmental work, are\nnot likely to be promptly solved.</p>\n\n<p>CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION.</p>\n\n<p>The work of the United States Civil Service Commission has been performed\nto the general satisfaction of the executive officers with whom the\nCommission has been brought into official communication. The volume of that\nwork and its variety and extent have under new laws, such as the Census\nAct, and new Executive orders, greatly increased. The activities of the\nCommission required by the statutes have reached to every portion of the\npublic domain.</p>\n\n<p>The accommodations of the Commission are most inadequate for its needs. I\ncall your attention to its request for increase in those accommodations as\nwill appear from the annual report for this year.</p>\n\n<p>POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS.</p>\n\n<p>I urgently recommend to Congress that a law be passed requiring that\ncandidates in elections of Members of the House of Representatives, and\ncommittees in charge of their candidacy and campaign, file in a proper\noffice of the United States Government a statement of the contributions\nreceived and of the expenditures incurred in the campaign for such\nelections and that similar legislation be enacted in respect to all other\nelections which are constitutionally within the control of Congress.</p>\n\n<p>FREEDMAN\'S SAVINGS AND TRUST COMPANY.</p>\n\n<p>Recommendations have been made by my predecessors that Congress appropriate\na sufficient sum to pay the balance--about 38 per cent.--of the amounts due\ndepositors in the Freedman\'s Savings and Trust Company. I renew this\nrecommendation, and advise also that a proper limitation be prescribed\nfixing a period within which the claims may be presented, that assigned\nclaims be not recognized, and that a limit be imposed on the amount of fees\ncollectible for services in presenting such claims.</p>\n\n<p>SEMI-CENTENNIAL OF NEGRO FREEDOM.</p>\n\n<p>The year 1913 will mark the fiftieth anniversary of the issuance of the\nEmancipation Proclamation granting freedom to the negroes. It seems fitting\nthat this event should be properly celebrated. Already a movement has been\nstarted by prominent Negroes, encouraged by prominent white people and the\npress. The South especially is manifesting its interest in this movement.</p>\n\n<p>It is suggested that a proper form of celebration would be an exposition to\nshow the progress the Negroes have made, not only during their period of\nfreedom, but also from the time of their coming to this country.</p>\n\n<p>I heartily indorse this proposal, and request that the Executive be\nauthorized to appoint a preliminary commission of not more than seven\npersons to consider carefully whether or not it is wise to hold such an\nexposition, and if so, to outline a plan for the enterprise. I further\nrecommend that such preliminary commission serve without salary, except as\nto their actual expenses, and that an appropriation be made to meet such\nexpenses. CONCLUSION.</p>\n\n<p>I have thus, in a message compressed as much as the subjects will permit,\nreferred to many of the legislative needs of the country, with the\nexceptions already noted. Speaking generally, the country is in a high\nstate of prosperity. There is every reason to believe that we are on the\neve of a substantial business expansion, and we have just garnered a\nharvest unexampled in the market value of our agricultural products. The\nhigh prices which such products bring mean great prosperity for the farming\ncommunity, but on the other hand they mean a very considerably increased\nburden upon those classes in the community whose yearly compensation does\nnot expand with the improvement in business and the general prosperity.\nVarious reasons are given for the high prices. The proportionate increase\nin the output of gold, which to-day is the chief medium of exchange and is\nin some respects a measure of value, furnishes a substantial explanation of\nat least a part of the increase in prices. The increase in population and\nthe more expensive mode of living of the people, which have not been\naccompanied by a proportionate increase in acreage production, may furnish\na further reason. It is well to note that the increase in the cost of\nliving is not confined to this country, but prevails the world over, and\nthat those who would charge increases in prices to the existing protective\ntariff must meet the fact that the rise in prices has taken place almost\nwholly in those products of the factory and farm in respect to which there\nhas been either no increase in the tariff or in many instances a very\nconsiderable reduction.\n</p>\n\t\t\t<div class="textNav"><a href="#top">^ Return to top</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>\n\t<div id="footer"><strong><em>State of the Union</em></strong> is a project\n\t\tby Brad Borevitz at <a href="http://www.onetwothree.net">onetwothree.net</a></div>\n</div>\n<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">\n</script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n_uacct = "UA-410742-1";\nurchinTracker();\n</script>\n</body>\n<!-- InstanceEnd -->\n</html>\n'
