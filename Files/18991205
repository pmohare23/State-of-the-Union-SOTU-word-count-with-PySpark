His great soul now rests in eternal peace.\nHis private life was pure and elevated, while his public career was ever\ndistinguished by large capacity, stainless integrity, and exalted motives.\nHe has been removed from the high office which he honored and dignified,\nbut his lofty character, his devotion to duty, his honesty of purpose, and\nnoble virtues remain with us as a priceless legacy and example.</p>\n\n<p>The Fifty-sixth Congress convenes in its first regular session with the\ncountry in a condition of unusual prosperity, of universal good will among\nthe people at home, and in relations of peace and friendship with every\ngovernment of the world. Our foreign commerce has shown great increase in\nvolume and value. The combined imports and exports for the year are the\nlargest ever shown by a single year in all our history. Our exports for\n1899 alone exceeded by more than a billion dollars our imports and exports\ncombined in 1870. The imports per capita are 20 per cent less than in 1870,\nwhile the exports per capita are 58 per cent more than in 1870, showing the\nenlarged capacity of the United States to satisfy the wants of its own\nincreasing population, as well as to contribute to those of the peoples of\nother nations.</p>\n\n<p>Exports of agricultural products were $784,776,142. Of manufactured\nproducts we exported in value $339,592,146, being larger than any previous\nyear. It is a noteworthy fact that the only years in all our history when\nthe products of our manufactories sold abroad exceeded those bought abroad\nwere 1898 and 1899.</p>\n\n<p>Government receipts from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 30,\n1899, including $11,798,314,14, part payment of the Central Pacific\nRailroad indebtedness, aggregated $610,982,004.35. Customs receipts were\n$206,128,481.75, and those from internal revenue $273,437,161.51.</p>\n\n<p>For the fiscal year the expenditures were $700,093,564.02, leaving a\ndeficit of $89,111,559.67.</p>\n\n<p>The Secretary of the Treasury estimates that the receipts for the current\nfiscal year will aggregate $640,958,112, and upon the basis of present\nappropriations the expenditures will aggregate $600,958,112, leaving a\nsurplus of $40,000,000.</p>\n\n<p>For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1899, the internal-revenue receipts were\nincreased about $100,000,000.</p>\n\n<p>The present gratifying strength of the Treasury is shown by the fact that\non December 1, 1899, the available cash balance was $278,004,837.72, Of\nwhich $239,744,905.36 was in gold coin and bullion. The conditions of\nconfidence which prevail throughout the country have brought gold into more\ngeneral use and customs receipts are now almost entirely paid in that\ncoin.</p>\n\n<p>The strong position of the Treasury with respect to cash on hand and the\nfavorable showing made by the revenues have made it possible for the\nSecretary of the Treasury to take action under the provisions of section\n3694, Revised Statutes, relating to the sinking fund. Receipts exceeded\nexpenditures for the first five months of the current fiscal year by\n$13,413,389.91, and, as mentioned above, the Secretary of the Treasury\nestimates that there will be a surplus of approximately $40,000,000 at the\nend of the year. Under such conditions it was deemed advisable and proper\nto resume compliance with the provisions of the sinking-fund law, which for\neight years has not been done because of deficiencies in the revenues. The\nTreasury Department therefore offered to purchase during November\n$25,000,000 of the 5 per cent loan of 1904, or the 4 per cent funded loan\nof 1907, at the current market price. The amount offered and purchased\nduring November was $18,408,600. The premium paid by the Government on such\npurchases was $2,263,521 and the net saving in interest was about\n$2,885,000. The success of this operation was sufficient to induce the\nGovernment to continue the offer to purchase bonds to and including the 23d\nday of December, instant, unless the remainder of the $25,000,000 called\nfor should be presented in the meantime for redemption.</p>\n\n<p>Increased activity in industry, with its welcome attendant--a larger\nemployment for labor at higher wages--gives to the body of the people a\nlarger power to absorb the circulating medium. It is further true that year\nby year, with larger areas of land under cultivation, the increasing volume\nof agricultural products, cotton, corn, and wheat, calls for a larger\nvolume of money supply. This is especially noticeable at the\ncrop-harvesting and crop-moving period.</p>\n\n<p>In its earlier history the National Banking Act seemed to prove a\nreasonable avenue through which needful additions to the circulation could\nfrom time to time be made. Changing conditions have apparently rendered it\nnow inoperative to that end. The high margin in bond securities required,\nresulting from large premiums which Government bonds command in the market,\nor the tax on note issues, or both operating together, appear to be the\ninfluences which impair its public utility.</p>\n\n<p>The attention of Congress is respectfully invited to this important matter,\nwith the view of ascertaining whether or not such reasonable modifications\ncan be made in the National Banking Act as will render its service in the\nparticulars here referred to more responsive to the people\'s needs. I again\nurge that national banks be authorized to organize with a capital of\n$25,000.</p>\n\n<p>I urgently recommend that to support the existing gold standard, and to\nmaintain "the parity in value of the coins of the two metals (gold and\nsilver) and the equal power of every dollar at all times in the market and\nin the payment of debts," the Secretary of the Treasury be given additional\npower and charged with the duty to sell United States bonds and to employ\nsuch other effective means as may be necessary to these ends. The authority\nshould include the power to sell bonds on long and short time, as\nconditions may require, and should provide for a rate of interest lower\nthan that fixed by the act of January 14, 1875. While there is now no\ncommercial fright which withdraws gold from the Government, but, on the\ncontrary, such widespread confidence that gold seeks the Treasury demanding\npaper money in exchange, yet the very situation points to the present as\nthe most fitting time to make adequate provision to insure the continuance\nof the gold standard and of public confidence in the ability and purpose of\nthe Government to meet all its obligations in the money which the civilized\nworld recognizes as the best. The financial transactions of the Government\nare conducted upon a gold basis. We receive gold when we sell United States\nbonds and use gold for their payment. We are maintaining the parity of all\nthe money issued or coined by authority of the Government. We are doing\nthese things with the means at hand. Happily at the present time we are not\ncompelled to resort to loans to supply gold. It has been done in the past,\nhowever, and may have to be done in the future. It behooves us, therefore,\nto provide at once the best means to meet the emergency when it arises, and\nthe best means are those which are the most certain and economical. Those\nnow authorized have the virtue neither of directness nor economy. We have\nalready eliminated one of the causes of our financial plight and\nembarrassment during the years 1893, 1894, 1895, and 1896. Our receipts now\nequal our expenditures; deficient revenues no longer create alarm Let us\nremove the only remaining cause by conferring the full and necessary power\non the Secretary of the Treasury and impose upon him the duty to uphold the\npresent gold standard and preserve the coins of the two metals on a parity\nwith each other, which is the repeatedly declared policy of the United\nStates.</p>\n\n<p>In this connection I repeat my former recommendations that a portion of the\ngold holdings shall be placed in a trust fund from which greenbacks shall\nbe redeemed upon presentation, but when once redeemed shall not thereafter\nbe paid out except for gold.</p>\n\n<p>The value of an American merchant marine to the extension of our commercial\ntrade and the strengthening of our power upon the sea invites the immediate\naction of the Congress. Our national development will be one-sided and\nunsatisfactory so long as the remarkable growth of our inland industries\nremains unaccompanied by progress on the seas. There is no lack of\nconstitutional authority for legislation which shall give to the country\nmaritime strength commensurate with its industrial achievements and with\nits rank among the nations of the earth,</p>\n\n<p>The past year has recorded exceptional activity in our shipyards, and the\npromises of continual prosperity in shipbuilding are abundant. Advanced\nlegislation for the protection of our seamen has been enacted. Our coast\ntrade, under regulations wisely framed at the beginning of the Government\nand since, shows results for the past fiscal year unequaled in our records\nor those of any other power. We shall fail to realize our opportunities,\nhowever, if we complacently regard only matters at home and blind ourselves\nto the necessity of securing our share in the valuable carrying trade of\nthe world.</p>\n\n<p>Last year American vessels transported a smaller share of our exports and\nimports than during any former year in all our history, and the measure of\nour dependence upon foreign shipping was painfully manifested to our\npeople. Without any choice of our own, but from necessity, the Departments\nof the Government charged with military and naval operations in the East\nand West Indies had to obtain from foreign flags merchant vessels essential\nfor those operations.</p>\n\n<p>The other great nations have not hesitated to adopt the required means to\ndevelop their shipping as a factor in national defense and as one of the\nsurest and speediest means of obtaining for their producers a share in\nforeign markets. Like vigilance and effort on our part cannot fail to\nimprove our situation, which is regarded with humiliation at home and with\nsurprise abroad. Even the seeming sacrifices, which at the beginning may be\ninvolved, will be offset later by more than equivalent gains.</p>\n\n<p>The expense is as nothing compared to the advantage to be achieved. The\nreestablishment of our merchant marine involves in a large measure our\ncontinued industrial progress and the extension of our commercial triumphs.\nI am satisfied the judgment of the country favors the policy of aid to our\nmerchant marine, which will broaden our commerce and markets and upbuild\nour sea-carrying capacity for the products of agriculture and manufacture;\nwhich, with the increase of our Navy, mean more work and wages to our\ncountrymen, as well as a safeguard to American interests in every part of\nthe world.</p>\n\n<p>Combinations of capital organized into trusts to control the conditions of\ntrade among our citizens, to stifle competition, limit production, and\ndetermine the prices of products used and consumed by the people, are\njustly provoking public discussion, and should early claim the attention of\nthe Congress.</p>\n\n<p>The Industrial Commission, created by the act of the Congress of June 18,\n1898, has been engaged in extended hearings upon the disputed questions\ninvolved in the subject of combinations in restraint of trade and\ncompetition. They have not yet completed their investigation of this\nsubject, and the conclusions and recommendations at which they may arrive\nare undetermined.</p>\n\n<p>The subject is one giving rise to many divergent views as to the nature and\nvariety or cause and extent of the injuries to the public which may result\nfrom large combinations concentrating more or less numerous enterprises and\nestablishments, which previously to the formation of the combination were\ncarried on separately.</p>\n\n<p>It is universally conceded that combinations which engross or control the\nmarket of any particular kind of merchandise or commodity necessary to the\ngeneral community, by suppressing natural and ordinary competition, whereby\nprices are unduly enhanced to the general consumer, are obnoxious not only\nto the common law but also to the public welfare. There must be a remedy\nfor the evils involved in such organizations. If the present law can be\nextended more certainly to control or check these monopolies or trusts, it\nshould be done without delay. Whatever power the Congress possesses over\nthis most important subject should be promptly ascertained and asserted.</p>\n\n<p>President Harrison in his annual message of December 3, 1889, says: Earnest\nattention should be given by Congress to a consideration of the question\nhow far the restraint of those combinations of capital commonly called\n"trusts" is matter of Federal jurisdiction. When organized, as they often\nare, to crush out all healthy competition and to monopolize the production\nor sale of an article of commerce and general necessity they are dangerous\nconspiracies against the public good, and should be made the subject of\nprohibitory and even penal legislation. An act to protect trade and\ncommerce against unlawful restraints and monopolies was passed by Congress\non the 2d of July, 1890. The provisions of this statute are comprehensive\nand stringent. It declares every contract or combination, in the form of a\ntrust or otherwise, or conspiracy in the restraint of trade or commerce\namong the several States or with foreign nations, to be unlawful. It\ndenominates as a criminal every person who makes any such contract or\nengages in any such combination or conspiracy, and provides a punishment by\nfine or imprisonment. It invests the several circuit courts of the United\nStates with jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of the act, and\nmakes it the duty of the several United States district attorneys, under\nthe direction of the Attorney General, to institute proceedings in equity\nto prevent and restrain such violations. It further confers upon any person\nwho shall be injured in his business or property by any other person or\ncorporation by reason of anything forbidden or declared to be unlawful by\nthe act, the power to sue therefore in any circuit court of the United\nStates without respect to the amount in controversy, and to recover\nthreefold the damages by him sustained and the costs of the suit, including\nreasonable attorney fees. It will be perceived that the act is aimed at\nevery kind of combination in the nature of a trust or monopoly in restraint\nof interstate or international commerce.</p>\n\n<p>The prosecution by the United States of offenses under the act of 1890 has\nbeen frequently resorted to in the Federal courts, and notable efforts in\nthe restraint of interstate commerce, such as the Trans-Missouri Freight\nAssociation and the joint Traffic Association, have been successfully\nopposed and suppressed.</p>\n\n<p>President Cleveland in his annual message of December 7, 1896--more than\nsix years subsequent to the enactment of this law--after stating the\nevils of these trust combinations, says: Though Congress has attempted to\ndeal with this matter by legislation, the laws passed for that purpose thus\nfar have proved ineffective, not because of any lack of disposition or\nattempt to enforce them, but simply because the laws themselves as\ninterpreted by the courts do not reach the difficulty. If the\ninsufficiencies of existing laws can be remedied by further legislation, it\nshould be done. The fact must be recognized, however, that all Federal\nlegislation on this subject may fall short of its purpose because of\ninherent obstacles, and also because of the complex character of our\ngovernmental system, which, while making the Federal authority supreme\nwithin its sphere, has carefully limited that sphere by metes and bounds\nwhich cannot be transgressed. The decision of our highest court on this\nprecise question renders it quite doubtful whether the evils of trusts and\nmonopolies may be adequately treated through Federal action, unless they\nseek directly and purposely to include in their objects transportation or\nintercourse between States or between the United States and foreign\ncountries. It does not follow, however, that this is the limit of the\nremedy that may be applied. Even though it may be found that Federal\nauthority is not broad enough to fully reach the case, there can be no\ndoubt of the power of the several States to act effectively in the\npremises, and there should be no reason to doubt their willingness to\njudiciously exercise such power. The State legislation to which President\nCleveland looked for relief from the evils of trusts has failed to\naccomplish fully that object. This is probably due to a great extent to the\nfact that different States take different views as to the proper way to\ndiscriminate between evil and injurious combinations and those associations\nwhich are beneficial and necessary to the business prosperity of the\ncountry. The great diversity of treatment in different States arising from\nthis cause and the intimate relations of all parts of the country to each\nother without regarding State lines in the conduct of business have made\nthe enforcement of State laws difficult.</p>\n\n<p>It is apparent that uniformity of legislation upon this subject in the\nseveral States is much to be desired. It is to be hoped that such\nuniformity founded in a wise and just discrimination between what is\ninjurious and what is useful and necessary in business operations may be\nobtained and that means may be found for the Congress within the\nlimitations of its constitutional power so to supplement an effective code\nof State legislation as to make a complete system of laws throughout the\nUnited States adequate to compel a general observance of the salutary rules\nto which I have referred.</p>\n\n<p>The whole question is so important and far-reaching that I am sure no part\nof it will be lightly considered, but every phase of it will have the\nstudied deliberation of the Congress, resulting in wise and judicious\naction.</p>\n\n<p>A review of our relations with foreign States is presented with such\nrecommendations as are deemed appropriate.</p>\n\n<p>The long-pending boundary dispute between the Argentine Republic and Chile\nwas settled in March last by the award of an arbitral commission, on which\nthe United States minister at Buenos Ayres served as umpire.</p>\n\n<p>Progress has been made toward the conclusion of a convention of extradition\nwith the Argentine Republic. Having been advised and consented to by the\nUnited States Senate and ratified by Argentina, it only awaits the\nadjustment of some slight changes in the text before exchange.</p>\n\n<p>In my last annual message I adverted to the claim of the Austro-Hungarian\nGovernment for indemnity for the killing of certain Austrian and Hungarian\nsubjects by the authorities of the State of Pennsylvania, at Lattimer,\nwhile suppressing an unlawful tumult of miners, September 10, 1897. In view\nof the verdict of acquittal rendered by the court before which the sheriff\nand his deputies were tried for murder, and following the established\ndoctrine that the Government may not be held accountable for injuries\nsuffered by individuals at the hands of the public authorities while acting\nin the line of duty in suppressing disturbance of the public peace, this\nGovernment, after due consideration of the claim advanced by the\nAustro-Hungarian Government, was constrained to decline liability to\nindemnify the sufferers.</p>\n\n<p>It is gratifying to be able to announce that the Belgian Government has\nmitigated the restrictions on the importation of cattle from the United\nStates, to which I referred in my last annual message.</p>\n\n<p>Having been invited by Belgium to participate in a congress, held at\nBrussels, to revise the provisions of the general act Of July 2, 1890, for\nthe repression of the African slave trade, to which the United States was a\nsignatory party, this Government preferred not to be represented by a\nplenipotentiary, but reserved the right of accession to the result. Notable\nchanges were made, those especially concerning this country being in the\nline of the increased restriction of the deleterious trade in spirituous\nliquors with the native tribes, which this Government has from the outset\nurgently advocated. The amended general act will be laid before the Senate,\nwith a view to its advice and consent.</p>\n\n<p>Early in the year the peace of Bolivia was disturbed by a successful\ninsurrection. The United States minister remained at his post, attending to\nthe American interests in that quarter, and using besides his good offices\nfor the protection of the interests of British subjects in the absence of\ntheir national representative. On the establishment of the new Government,\nour minister was directed to enter into relations therewith.</p>\n\n<p>General Pando was elected President of Bolivia on October 23.</p>\n\n<p>Our representative has been instructed to use all permissible friendly\nendeavors to induce the Government of Bolivia to amend its marriage laws so\nas to give legal status to the non-Catholic and civil marriages of aliens\nwithin its jurisdiction, and strong hopes are entertained that the Bolivian\nlaw in this regard will be brought, as was that of Peru some years ago,\ninto harmony with the general practice of modern States.</p>\n\n<p>A convention of extradition with Brazil, signed May 14, 1897, has been\nratified by the Brazilian Legislature.</p>\n\n<p>During the past summer two national ships of the United States have visited\nBrazilian ports on a friendly mission and been cordially received. The\nvoyage of the Wilmington up the Amazon River gave rise to a passing\nmisunderstanding, owing to confusion in obtaining permission to visit the\ninterior and make surveys in the general interest of navigation, but the\nincident found a ready adjustment in harmony with the close relations of\namity which this Government has always sedulously sought to cultivate with\nthe commonwealths of the Western Continent.</p>\n\n<p>The claim growing out of the seizure of the American-owned newspaper "The\nPanama Star and Herald" by the authorities of Colombia has been settled,\nafter a controversy of several years, by an agreement assessing at $30,000\nthe indemnity to be paid by the Colombian Government, in three installments\nof $10,000 each.</p>\n\n<p>The good will of Colombia toward our country has been testified anew by the\ncordial extension of facilities to the Nicaraguan Canal Commission in their\napproaching investigation of the Panama Canal and other projected routes\nacross the Isthmus of Darien.</p>\n\n<p>Toward the end of October an insurrectionary disturbance developed in the\nColombian Republic. This movement has thus far not attained any decisive\nresult and is still in progress.</p>\n\n<p>Discussion of the questions raised by the action of Denmark in imposing\nrestrictions on the importation of American meats has continued without\nsubstantial result in our favor.</p>\n\n<p>The neighboring island Republic of Santo Domingo has lately been the scene\nof revolution, following a long period of tranquility. It began with the\nkilling of President Heureaux in July last, and culminated in the\nrelinquishment by the succeeding Vice-President of the reins of government\nto the insurgents. The first act of the provisional government was the\ncalling of a presidential and constituent election. Juan Isidro Jimenez,\nhaving been elected President, was inaugurated on the 14th of November.\nRelations have been entered into with the newly established Government.</p>\n\n<p>The experimental association of Nicaragua, Honduras, and Salvador, tinder\nthe title of the Greater Republic of Central America, when apparently on\nthe threshold of a complete federal organization by the adoption of a\nconstitution and the formation of a national legislature, was disrupted in\nthe last days of November, 1898, by the withdrawal of Salvador. Thereupon\nNicaragua and Honduras abandoned the joint compact, each resuming its\nformer independent sovereignty. This was followed by the reception of\nMinister Merry by the Republics of Nicaragua and Salvador, while Minister\nHunter in turn presented his credentials to the Government of Honduras,\nthus reverting to the old distribution of the diplomatic agencies of the\nUnited States in Central America for which our existing statutes provide. A\nNicaraguan envoy has been accredited to the United States.</p>\n\n<p>An insurrectionary movement, under General Reyes, broke out at Bluefields\nin February last, and for a time exercised actual control in the Mosquito\nTerritory. The Detroit was promptly sent thither for the protection of\nAmerican interests. After a few weeks the Reyes government renounced the\nconflict, giving place to the restored supremacy of Nicaragua. During the\ninterregnum certain public dues accruing under Nicaraguan law were\ncollected from American merchants by the authorities for the time being in\neffective administrative control. Upon the titular government regaining\npower, a second payment of these dues was demanded. Controversy arose\ntouching the validity of the original payment of the debt to the de facto\nregent of the territory. An arrangement was effected in April last by the\nUnited States minister and the foreign secretary of Nicaragua whereby the\namounts of the duplicate payments were deposited with the British consul\npending an adjustment of the matter by direct agreement between the\nGovernments of the United States and Nicaragua. The controversy is still\nunsettled.</p>\n\n<p>The contract of the Maritime Canal Company of Nicaragua was declared\nforfeited by the Nicaraguan Government on the Tenth of October, on the\nground of nonfulfillment within the ten years\' term stipulated in the\ncontract. The Maritime Canal Company has lodged a protest against this\naction, alleging rights in the premises which appear worthy of\nconsideration. This Government expects that Nicaragua will afford the\nprotestants a full and fair hearing upon the merits of the case.</p>\n\n<p>The Nicaragua Canal Commission, which had been engaged upon the work of\nexamination and survey for a ship-canal route across Nicaragua, having\ncompleted its labors and made its report, was dissolved on May P, and on\nJune To a new commission, known as the Isthmian Canal Commission, was\norganized under the terms of the act approved March 3, 1899, for the\npurpose of examining the American Isthmus with a view to determining the\nmost practicable and feasible route for a ship canal across that Isthmus,\nwith its probable cost, and other essential details.</p>\n\n<p>This Commission, under the presidency of Rear-Admiral John G. Walker, U. S.\nN. (retired), entered promptly upon the work intrusted to it, and is now\ncarrying on examinations in Nicaragua along the route of the Panama Canal,\nand in Darien from the Atlantic, in the neighborhood of the Atrato River,\nto the Bay of Panama, on the Pacific side. Good progress has been made, but\nunder the law a comprehensive and complete investigation is called for,\nwhich will require much labor and considerable time for its accomplishment.\nThe work will be prosecuted as expeditiously as possible and a report made\nat the earliest practicable date.</p>\n\n<p>The great importance of this work cannot be too often or too strongly\npressed upon the attention of the Congress. In my message of a year ago I\nexpressed my views of the necessity of a canal which would link the two\ngreat oceans, to which I again invite your consideration. The reasons then\npresented for early action are even stronger now.</p>\n\n<p>A pleasing incident in the relations of this Government with that of Chile\noccurred in the generous assistance given to the war ship Newark when in\ndistress in Chilean waters. Not alone in this way has the friendly\ndisposition of Chile found expression. That country has acceded to the\nconvention for the establishment of the Bureau of the American Republics,\nin which organization every independent State of the continent now shares.</p>\n\n<p>The exchange of ratifications of a convention for the revival of the United\nStates and Chilean Claims Commission and for the adjudication of claims\nheretofore presented but not determined during the life of the previous\nCommission has been delayed by reason of the necessity for fresh action by\nthe Chilean Senate upon the amendments attached to the ratification of the\ntreaty by the United States Senate. This formality is soon to be\naccomplished.</p>\n\n<p>In view of disturbances in the populous provinces of northern China, where\nare many of our citizens, and of the imminence of disorder near the capital\nand toward the seaboard, a guard of marines was landed from the Boston and\nstationed during last winter in the legation compound at Peking. With the\nrestoration of order this protection was withdrawn.</p>\n\n<p>The interests of our citizens in that vast Empire have not been neglected\nduring the past year. Adequate protection has been secured for our\nmissionaries and some injuries to their property have been redressed.</p>\n\n<p>American capital has sought and found various opportunities of competing to\ncarry out the internal improvements which the Imperial Government is wisely\nencouraging, and to develop the natural resources of the Empire. Our trade\nwith China has continued to grow, and our commercial rights under existing\ntreaties have been everywhere maintained during the past year, as they will\nbe in the future.</p>\n\n<p>The extension of the area open to international foreign settlement at\nShanghai and the opening of the ports of Nanking, Tsing-tao (Kiao chao),\nand Ta-lien-wan to foreign trade and settlement will doubtless afford\nAmerican enterprise additional facilities and new fields, of which it will\nnot be slow to take advantage.</p>\n\n<p>In my message to Congress of December 5, 1898, I urged that the\nrecommendation which had been made to the Speaker of the House of\nRepresentatives by the Secretary of the Treasury on the 14th of June, 1898,\nfor an appropriation for a commission to study the commercial and\nindustrial conditions in the Chinese Empire and report as to the\nopportunities for, and obstacles to, the enlargement of markets in China\nfor the raw products and manufactures of the United States, should receive\nat your hands the consideration which its importance and timeliness\nmerited, but the Congress failed to take action.</p>\n\n<p>I now renew this recommendation, as the importance of the subject has\nsteadily grown since it was first submitted to you, and no time should be\nlost in studying for ourselves the resources of this great field for\nAmerican trade and enterprise.</p>\n\n<p>The death of President Faure in February last called forth those sincere\nexpressions of sympathy which befit the relations of two Republics as\nclosely allied by unbroken historic ties as are the United States and\nFrance.</p>\n\n<p>Preparations for the representation of the industries, arts, and products\nof the United States at the World\'s Exposition to be held in Paris next\nyear continue on an elaborate and comprehensive scale, thanks to the\ngenerous appropriation provided by Congress and to the friendly interest\nthe French Government has shown in furthering a typical exhibit of American\nprogress.</p>\n\n<p>There has been allotted to the United States a considerable addition of\nspace, which, while placing our country in the first rant among exhibitors,\ndoes not suffice to meet the increasingly urgent demands of our\nmanufacturers. The efforts of the Commissioner General are ably directed\ntoward a strictly representative display of all that most\ncharacteristically marks American achievement in the inventive arts, and\nmost adequately shows the excellence of our natural productions.</p>\n\n<p>In this age of keen rivalry among nations for mastery in commerce, the\ndoctrine of evolution and the rule of the survival of the fittest must be\nas inexorable in their operation as they are positive in the results they\nbring about. The place won in the struggle by an industrial people can only\nbe held by unrelaxed endeavor and constant advance in achievement. The\npresent extraordinary impetus in every line of American exportation and the\nastounding increase in the volume and value of our share in the world\'s\nmarkets may not be attributed to accidental conditions.</p>\n\n<p>The reasons are not far to seek. They lie deep in our national character\nand find expression year by year in every branch of handicraft, in every\nnew device whereby the materials we so abundantly produce are subdued to\nthe artisan\'s will and made to yield the largest, most practical, and most\nbeneficial return. The American exhibit at Paris should, and I am confident\nwill, be an open volume, whose lessons of skillfully directed endeavor,\nunfaltering energy, and consummate performance may be read by all on every\npage, thus spreading abroad a clearer knowledge of the worth of our\nproductions and the justice of our claim to an important place in the marts\nof the world. To accomplish this by judicious selection, by recognition of\nparamount merit in whatever walk of trade or manufacture it may appear, and\nby orderly classification and attractive installation is the task of our\nCommission.</p>\n\n<p>The United States Government building is approaching completion, and no\neffort will be spared to make it worthy, in beauty of architectural plan\nand in completeness of display, to represent our nation. It has been\nsuggested that a permanent building of similar or appropriate design be\nerected on a convenient site, already given by the municipality, near the\nexposition grounds, to serve in commemoration of the part taken by this\ncountry in this great enterprise, as an American National Institute, for\nour countrymen resorting to Paris for study.</p>\n\n<p>I am informed by our Commissioner-General that we shall have in the\nAmerican sections at Paris over 7,000 exhibitors, from every State ill our\ncountry, a number ten times as great as those which were represented at\nVienna in 1873, six times as many as those in Paris in 1878, and four times\nas many as those who exhibited in Paris in 1889. This statement does not\ninclude the exhibits from either Cuba, Puerto Rico, or Hawaii, for which\narrangements have been made.</p>\n\n<p>A number of important international congresses on special topics affecting\npublic interests are proposed to be held in Paris next summer in connection\nwith the exposition. Effort will be made to have the several technical\nbranches of our administration efficiently represented at those\nconferences, each in its special line, and to procure the largest possible\nconcourse of State representatives, particularly at the Congresses of\nPublic Charity and Medicine.</p>\n\n<p>Our relations with Germany continue to be most cordial. The increasing\nintimacy of direct association has been marked during the year by the\ngranting permission in April for the landing on our shores of a cable from\nBorkum Emden, on the North Sea, by way of the Azores, and also by the\nconclusion on September 2 of a Parcels Post Convention with the German\nEmpire. In all that promises closer relations of intercourse and commerce\nand a better understanding between two races having so many traits in\ncommon, Germany can be assured of the most cordial cooperation of this\nGovernment and people. We may be rivals in many material paths, but our\nrivalry should be generous and open, ever aiming toward the attainment of\nlarger results and the mutually beneficial advancement of each in the line\nof its especial adaptabilities.</p>\n\n<p>The several governments of the Empire seem reluctant to admit the natural\nexcellence of our food productions and to accept the evidence we constantly\ntender of the care with which their purity is guarded by rigid inspection\nfrom the farm, through the slaughterhouse and the packing establishments,\nto the port of shipment. Our system of control over exported food staples\ninvites examination from any quarter and challenges respect by its\nefficient thoroughness.</p>\n\n<p>It is to be hoped that in time the two Governments will act in common\naccord toward the realization of their common purpose to safeguard the\npublic health and to insure the purity and wholesomeness of all food\nproducts imported by either country from the other. Were the Congress to\nauthorize an invitation to Germany, in connection with the pending\nreciprocity negotiations, for the constitution of a joint commission of\nscientific experts and practical men of affairs to conduct a searching\ninvestigation of food production and exportation in both countries and\nreport to their respective legislatures for the adoption of such remedial\nmeasures as they might recommend for either, the way might be opened for\nthe desirable result indicated.</p>\n\n<p>Efforts to obtain for American life insurance companies a full hearing as\nto their business operations in Prussia have, after several years of\npatient representation, happily succeeded, and one of the most important\nAmerican companies has been granted a concession to continue business in\nthat Kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>I am also glad to announce that the German insurance companies have been\nreadmitted by the superintendent of insurance to do business in the State\nof New York.</p>\n\n<p>Subsequent to the exchange of our peace treaty with Spain, Germany acquired\nthe Caroline Islands by purchase, paying therefore $5,000,000. Assurances\nhave been received from the German Government that the rights of American\nmissionaries and traders there will be considerately observed.</p>\n\n<p>In my last annual message I referred to the pending negotiations with Great\nBritain in respect to the Dominion of Canada. By means of an executive\nagreement, a joint High Commission had been created for the purpose of\nadjusting all unsettled questions between the United States and Canada,\nembracing twelve subjects, among which were the questions of the fur seals,\nthe fisheries of the coast and contiguous inland waters, the Alaskan\nboundary, the transit of merchandise in bond, the alien labor laws, mining\nrights, reciprocity in trade, revision of the agreement respecting naval\nvessels in the Great Lakes, a more complete marking of parts of the\nboundary, provision for the conveyance of criminals, and for wrecking and\nsalvage.</p>\n\n<p>Much progress had been made by the Commission toward the adjustment of many\nof these questions, when it became apparent that an irreconcilable\ndifference of views was entertained respecting the delimitation of the\nAlaskan, boundary. In the failure of an agreement as to the meaning of\nArticles III and IV of the treaty of 1825 between Russia and Great Britain,\nwhich defined the boundary between Alaska and Canada, the American\nCommissioners proposed that the subject of the boundary be laid aside, and\nthat the remaining questions of difference be proceeded with, some of which\nwere so far advanced as to assure the probability of a settlement. This\nbeing declined by the British Commissioners, an adjournment was taken until\nthe boundary should be adjusted by the two Governments. The subject has\nbeen receiving the careful attention which its importance demands, with the\nresult that a modus vivendi for provisional demarcations in the region\nabout the head of Lynn Canal has, been agreed upon; and it is hoped that\nthe negotiations now in progress between the two Governments will end in an\nagreement for the establishment and delimitation of a permanent boundary.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from these questions growing out of our relationship with our\nnorthern neighbor, the most friendly disposition and ready agreement have\nmarked the discussion of numerous matters arising in the vast and intimate\nintercourse of the United States with Great Britain.</p>\n\n<p>This Government has maintained an attitude of neutrality in the unfortunate\ncontest between Great Britain and the Boer States of Africa. We have\nremained faithful to the precept of avoiding entangling alliances as to\naffairs not of our direct concern. Had circumstances suggested that the\nparties to the quarrel would have welcomed any kindly expression of the\nhope of the American people that war might be averted, good offices would\nhave been gladly tendered. The United States representative at Pretoria was\nearly instructed to see that all neutral American interests be respected by\nthe combatants. This has been an easy task in view of the positive\ndeclarations of both British and Boer authorities that the personal and\nproperty rights of our citizens should be observed.</p>\n\n<p>Upon the withdrawal of the British agent from Pretoria the United States\nconsul was authorized, upon the request of the British Government and with\nthe assent of the South African and Orange Free State Governments, to\nexercise the customary good offices of a neutral for the care of British\ninterests. In the discharge of this function, I am happy to say that\nabundant opportunity has been afforded to show the impartiality of this\nGovernment toward both the combatants.</p>\n\n<p>For the fourth time in the present decade, question has arisen with the\nGovernment of Italy in regard to the lynching of Italian subjects. The\nlatest of these deplorable events occurred at Tallulah, Louisiana, whereby\nfive unfortunates of Italian origin were taken from jail and hanged.</p>\n\n<p>The authorities of the State and a representative of the Italian Embassy\nhaving separately investigated the occurrence, with discrepant results,\nparticularly as to the alleged citizenship of the victims, and it not\nappearing that the State had been able to discover and punish the violators\nof the law, an independent investigation has been set on foot, through the\nagency of the Department of State, and is still in progress. The result\nwill enable the Executive to treat the question with the Government of\nItaly in a spirit of fairness and justice. A satisfactory solution will\ndoubtless be reached.</p>\n\n<p>The recurrence of these distressing manifestations of blind mob fury\ndirected at dependents or natives of a foreign country suggests that the\ncontingency has arisen for action by Congress in the direction of\nconferring upon the Federal courts jurisdiction in this class of\ninternational cases where the ultimate responsibility of the Federal\nGovernment may be involved. The suggestion is not new. In his annual\nmessage of December 9, 1891, my predecessor, President Harrison, said: It\nwould, I believe, be entirely competent for Congress to make offenses\nagainst the treaty rights of foreigners domiciled in the United States\ncognizable in the Federal courts. This has not, however, been done, and the\nFederal officers and courts have no power in such cases to intervene either\nfor the protection of a foreign citizen or for the punishment of his\nslayers. It seems to me to follow, in this state of the law, that the\nofficers of the State charged with police and judicial powers in such cases\nmust, in the consideration of international questions growing out of such\nincidents, be regarded in such sense as Federal agents as to make this\nGovernment answerable for their acts in cases where it would be answerable\nif the United States had used its constitutional power to define and punish\ncrimes against treaty rights. A bill to provide for the punishment of\nviolations of treaty rights of aliens was introduced in the Senate March 1,\n1892, and reported favorably March 30. Having doubtless in view the\nlanguage of that part of Article III of the treaty of February 26, 1871,\nbetween the United States and Italy, which stipulates that "The citizens\nof each of the high contracting parties shall receive, in the States and\nTerritories of the other, most constant protection and security for their\npersons and property, and shall enjoy in this respect the same rights and\nprivileges as are or shall be granted to the natives, on their submitting\nthemselves to the conditions imposed upon the natives," the bill so\nintroduced and reported provided that any act committed in any State or\nTerritory of the United States in violation of the rights of a citizen or\nsubject of a foreign country secured to such citizen or subject by treaty\nbetween the United States and such foreign country and constituting a crime\nunder the laws of the State or Territory shall constitute a like crime\nagainst the United States and be cognizable in the Federal courts. No\naction was taken by Congress in the matter.</p>\n\n<p>I earnestly recommend that the subject be taken up anew and acted upon\nduring the present session. The necessity for some such provision\nabundantly appears. Precedent for constituting a Federal jurisdiction in\ncriminal cases where aliens are sufferers is rationally deducible from the\nexisting statute, which gives to the district and circuit courts of the\nUnited States jurisdiction of civil suits brought by aliens where the\namount involved exceeds a certain sum. If such jealous solicitude be shown\nfor alien rights in cases of merely civil and pecuniary import, how much\ngreater should be the public duty to take cognizance of matters affecting\nthe lives and the rights of aliens tinder the settled principles of\ninternational law no less than under treaty stipulation, in cases of such\ntranscendent wrong-doing as mob murder, especially when experience has\nshown that local justice is too often helpless to punish the offenders.</p>\n\n<p>After many years of endeavor on the part of this Government to that end the\nItalian Government has consented to enter into negotiations for a\nnaturalization convention, having for one of its objects the regulation of\nthe status of Italians (except those of an age for active military service)\nwho, having been naturalized in the United States, may revisit Italy. It is\nhoped that with the mutually conciliatory spirit displayed a successful\nconclusion will be reached.</p>\n\n<p>The treaty of commerce and navigation between the United States and Japan\non November 22, 1894, took effect in accordance with the terms of its XIXth\nArticle on the 17th of July last, simultaneously with the enforcement of\nlike treaties with the other powers, except France, whose convention did\nnot go into operation until August 4, the United States being, however,\ngranted up to that date all the privileges and rights accorded to French\ncitizens under the old French treaty. By this notable conventional reform\nJapan\'s position as a fully independent sovereign power is assured, control\nbeing gained of taxation, customs revenues, judicial administration,\ncoasting trade, and all other domestic functions of government, and foreign\nextra-territorial rights being renounced.</p>\n\n<p>Comprehensive codes of civil and criminal procedure according to western\nmethods, public instruction, patents and copyrights, municipal\nadministration, including jurisdiction over the former foreign settlements,\ncustoms tariffs and procedure, public health, and other administrative\nmeasures have been proclaimed. The working of the new system has given rise\nto no material complaints on the part of the American citizens or\ninterests, a circumstance which attests the ripe consideration with which\nthe change has been prepared.</p>\n\n<p>Valuable assistance was rendered by the Japanese authorities to the United\nStates transport ship Morgan City while stranded at Kobe. Permission has\nbeen granted to land and pasture army horses at Japanese ports of call on\nthe way to the Philippine Islands. These kindly evidences of good will are\nhighly appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>The Japanese Government has shown a lively interest in the proposition of\nthe Pacific Cable Company to add to its projected cable lines to Hawaii,\nGuam, and the Philippines a branch connection with the coast of Japan. It\nwould be a gratifying consummation were the utility of the contemplated\nscheme enhanced by bringing Japan and the United States into direct\ntelegraphic relation.</p>\n\n<p>Without repeating the observations of my special message of February 10,\n1899, concerning the necessity of a cable to Manila. I respectfully invite\nattention to it.</p>\n\n<p>I recommend that, in case the Congress should not take measures to bring\nabout this result by direct action of the Government, the Postmaster\nGeneral be authorized to invite competitive bids for the establishment of a\ncable; the company making the best responsible bid to be awarded the\ncontract; the successful company to give ample bonds to insure the\ncompletion of the work within a reasonable time.</p>\n\n<p>The year has been marked by constant increase in the intimacy of our\nrelations with Mexico and in the magnitude of mutually advantageous\ninterchanges. This Government has omitted no opportunity to show its strong\ndesire to develop and perpetuate the ties of cordiality now so long happily\nunbroken.</p>\n\n<p>Following the termination on January 20, 1899, by Mexico of the convention\nof extradition of December 11, 1861, a new treaty more in accordance with\nthe ascertained needs of both countries was signed February 22, 1899, and\nexchanged in the City of Mexico on the 22d of April last. Its operation\nthus far has been effective and satisfactory. A recent case has served to\ntest the application of its IVth Article, which provides that neither party\nshall be bound to deliver up its own citizens, but that the executive\nauthority of each shall have the power to deliver them up if in its\ndiscretion it be deemed proper to do so.</p>\n\n<p>The extradition of Mrs. Mattie Rich, a citizen of the United States,\ncharged with homicide committed in Mexico, was after mature consideration\ndirected by me in the conviction that the ends of justice would be thereby\nsubserved. Similar action, on appropriate occasion, by the Mexican\nExecutive will not only tend to accomplish the desire of both Governments\nthat grave crimes go not unpunished, but also to repress lawlessness along\nthe border of the two countries. The new treaty stipulates that neither\nGovernment shall assume jurisdiction in the punishment of crimes committed\nexclusively within the territory of the other. This will obviate in future\nthe embarrassing controversies which have heretofore arisen through\nMexico\'s assertion of a claim to try and punish an American citizen for an\noffense committed within the jurisdiction of the United States.</p>\n\n<p>The International Water Boundary Commission, organized by the convention of\nMarch 1, 1889, for the adjustment of questions affecting the Rio Grande\nfrontier, has not yet completed its labors. A further extension of its term\nfor one year, until December 24, 1899, was effected by a convention signed\nDecember z, 1898, and exchanged and proclaimed in February last.</p>\n\n<p>An invitation extended to the President of Mexico to visit Chicago in\nOctober, on the occasion of laying the corner stone of the United States\nGovernment building in that city, was cordially accepted by him, with the\nnecessary consent of the Mexican Congress, but the illness of a member of\nhis family prevented his attendance. The Minister of Foreign Relations,\nhowever, came as the personal representative of President Diaz, and in that\nhigh character was duly honored.</p>\n\n<p>Claims growing out of the seizure of American sealing vessels in Bering Sea\nhave been under discussion with the Government of Russia for several years,\nwith the recent happy result of an agreement to submit them to the decision\nof a single arbitrator. By this act Russia affords proof of her adherence\nto the beneficent principle of arbitration which her plenipotentiaries\nconspicuously favored at The Hague Disarmament Conference when it was\nadvocated by the representatives of the United States.</p>\n\n<p>A suggestion for a permanent exposition of our products and manufactures in\nRussia, although not yet fully shaped, has been so cordially welcomed by\nthe Imperial Government that it may not inaptly take a fitting place in\nwhatever legislation the Congress may adopt looking to enlargement of our\ncommercial opportunities abroad.</p>\n\n<p>Important events have occurred in the Samoan Islands. The election,\naccording to the laws and customs of Samoa, of a successor to the late\nKing, Malietoa Laupepa, developed a contest as to the validity of the\nresult, which issue, by the terms of the General Act, was to be decided by\nthe Chief justice. Upon his rendering a judgment in favor of Malietoa Tanu,\nthe rival chief, Mataafa, took up arms. The active intervention of American\nand British war ships became imperative to restore order, at the cost of\nsanguinary encounters. In this emergency a joint commission of\nrepresentatives of the United States, Germany, and Great Britain was sent\nto Samoa to investigate the situation and provide a temporary remedy. By\nits active efforts a peaceful solution was reached for the time being, the\nkingship being abolished and a provisional government established.\nRecommendations unanimously made by the commission for a permanent\nadjustment of the Samoan question were taken under consideration by the\nthree powers parties to the General Act. But the more they were examined\nthe more evident it became that a radical change was necessary in the\nrelations of the powers to Samoa.</p>\n\n<p>The inconveniences and possible perils of the tripartite scheme of\nsupervision and control in the Samoan group by powers having little\ninterest in common in that quarter beyond commercial rivalry had been once\nmore emphasized by the recent events. The suggested remedy of the joint\nCommission, like the scheme it aimed to replace amounted to what has been\nstyled a tridominium, being the exercise of the functions of sovereignty by\nan unanimous agreement of three powers. The situation had become far more\nintricate and embarrassing from every point of view than it was when my\npredecessor, in 1894, summed up its perplexities and condemned the\nparticipation in it of the United States.</p>\n\n<p>The arrangement under which Samoa was administered had proved impracticable\nand unacceptable to all the powers concerned. To withdraw from the\nagreement and abandon the islands to Germany and Great Britain would not be\ncompatible with our interests in the archipelago. To relinquish our rights\nin the harbor of Pago Pago, the best anchorage in the Pacific, the\noccupancy of which had been leased to the United States in 1878 by the\nfirst foreign treaty ever concluded by Samoa, was not to be thought of\neither as regards the needs of our Navy or the interests of our growing\ncommerce with the East. We could not have considered any proposition for\nthe abrogation of the tripartite control which did not confirm us in all\nour rights and safeguard all our national interests in the islands.</p>\n\n<p>Our views commended themselves to the other powers. A satisfactory\narrangement was concluded between the Governments of Germany and of\nEngland, by virtue of which England retired from Samoa in view of\ncompensations in other directions, and both powers renounced in favor of\nthe United States all their rights and claims over and in respect to that\nportion of the group lying to the east of the one hundred and seventy-first\ndegree of west longitude, embracing the islands of Tutuila, Ofoo, Olosenga,\nand Manua. I transmit to the Senate, for its constitutional action thereon,\na convention, which besides the provisions above mentioned also guarantees\nus the same privileges and conditions in respect to commerce and commercial\nvessels in all of the islands of Samoa as those possessed by Germany.</p>\n\n<p>Claims have been preferred by white residents of Samoa on account of\ninjuries alleged to have been suffered through the acts of the treaty\nGovernments in putting down the late disturbances. A convention has been\nmade between the three powers for the investigation and settlement of these\nclaims by a neutral arbitrator, to which the attention of the Senate will\nbe invited.</p>\n\n<p>My annual message of last year was necessarily devoted, in great part to a\nconsideration of the Spanish War and of the results it wrought and the\nconditions it imposed for the future. I am gratified to announce that the\ntreaty of peace has restored friendly relations between the two powers.\nEffect has been given to its most important provisions. The evacuation of\nPuerto Rico having already been accomplished on the XIVth of October, 1898,\nnothing remained necessary there but to continue the provisional military\ncontrol of the island until the Congress should enact a suitable government\nfor the ceded territory. Of the character and scope of the measures to that\nend I shall treat in another part of this message.</p>\n\n<p>The withdrawal of the authority of Spain from the island of Cuba was\neffected by the 1st of January, so that the full re-establishment of peace\nfound the relinquished territory held by us in trust for the inhabitants,\nmaintaining, under the direction of the Executive, such government and\ncontrol therein as should conserve public order, restore the productive\nconditions of peace so long disturbed by the instability and disorder which\nprevailed for the greater part of the preceding three decades, and build up\nthat tranquil development of the domestic state whereby alone can be\nrealized the high purpose, as proclaimed in the joint resolution adopted by\nthe Congress on the 19th of April, 1898, by which the United States\ndisclaimed any disposition or intention to exercise sovereignty,\njurisdiction, or control over Cuba, except for the pacification thereof,\nand asserted its determination when that was accomplished to leave the\ngovernment and control of the island to its people. The pledge contained in\nthis resolution is of the highest honorable obligation and must be sacredly\nkept.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that substantial progress has been made in this direction. All\nthe administrative measures adopted in Cuba have aimed to fit it for a\nregenerated existence by enforcing the supremacy of law and justice; by\nplacing wherever practicable the machinery of administration in the hands\nof the inhabitants; by instituting needed sanitary reforms; by spreading\neducation; by fostering industry and trade; by inculcating public morality,\nand, in short, by taking every rational step to aid the Cuban people to\nattain to that plane of self-conscious respect and self-reliant unity which\nfits an enlightened community for self-government within its own sphere,\nwhile enabling it to fulfill all outward obligation.</p>\n\n<p>This nation has assumed before the world a grave responsibility for the\nfuture good government of Cuba. We have accepted a trust the fulfillment of\nwhich calls for the sternest integrity of purpose and the exercise of the\nhighest wisdom. The new Cuba yet to arise from the ashes of the past must\nneeds be bound to us by ties of singular intimacy and strength if its\nenduring welfare is to be assured. Whether those ties shall be organic or\nconventional, the destinies of Cuba are in some rightful form and manner\nirrevocably linked with our own, but how and how far is for the future to\ndetermine in the ripeness of events. Whatever be the outcome, we must see\nto it that free Cuba be a reality, not a name, a perfect entity, not a\nhasty experiment bearing within itself the elements of failure. Our\nmission, to accomplish which we took up the wager of battle, is not to be\nfulfilled by turning adrift any loosely framed commonwealth to face the\nvicissitudes which too often attend weaker States whose natural wealth and\nabundant resources are offset by the incongruities of their political\norganization and the recurring occasions for internal rivalries to sap\ntheir strength and dissipate their energies. The greatest blessing which\ncan come to Cuba is the restoration of her agricultural and industrial\nprosperity, which will give employment to idle men and re-establish the\npursuits of peace. This is her chief and immediate need.</p>\n\n<p>On the 19th of August last an order was made for the taking of the census\nin the island, to be completed on the 30th of November. By the treaty of\npeace the Spanish people on the island have until April 11, 1900, to elect\nwhether they will remain citizens of Spain or become citizens of Cuba.\nUntil then it cannot be definitely ascertained who shall be entitled to\nparticipate in the formation of the government of Cuba. By that time the\nresults of the census will have been tabulated and we shall proceed to\nprovide for elections which will commit the municipal governments of the\nisland to the officers elected by the people. The experience thus acquired\nwill prove of great value in the formation of a representative convention\nof the people to draft a constitution and establish a general system of\nindependent government for the island. In the meantime and so long as we\nexercise control over the island the products of Cuba should have a market\nin the United States on as good terms and with as favorable rates of duty\nas are given to the West India Islands under treaties of reciprocity which\nshall be made.</p>\n\n<p>For the relief of the distressed in the island of Cuba the War Department\nhas issued supplies to destitute persons through the officers of the Army,\nwhich have amounted to 5,493,000 rations, at a cost Of $1,417,554.07.</p>\n\n<p>To promote the disarmament of the Cuban volunteer army, and in the interest\nof public peace and the welfare of the people, the sum Of $75 was paid to\neach Cuban soldier borne upon the authenticated rolls, on condition that he\nshould deposit his arms with the authorities designated by the United\nStates. The sum thus disbursed aggregated $2,547,750, which was paid from\nthe emergency fund provided by the act of January 5, 1899, for that\npurpose.</p>\n\n<p>Out of the Cuban island revenues during the six months ending June 30,\n1899, $1,712,014.20 was expended for sanitation, $293,881.70 for charities\nand hospitals, and $88,944.03 for aid to the destitute.</p>\n\n<p>Following the exchange of ratifications of the treaty of peace the two\nGovernments accredited ministers to each other, Spain sending to Washington\nthe Duke of Arcos, an eminent diplomatist, previously stationed in Mexico,\nwhile the United States transferred to Madrid Hon. Bellamy Storer, its\nminister at Brussels. This was followed by the respective appointment of\nconsuls, thereby fully resuming the relations interrupted by the war. In\naddition to its consular representation in the United States, the Spanish\nGovernment has appointed consuls for Cuba, who have been provisionally\nrecognized during the military administration of the affairs of that\nisland.</p>\n\n<p>Judicial intercourse between the courts of Cuba and Puerto Rico and of\nSpain has been established, as provided by the treaty of peace. The Cuban\npolitical prisoners in Spanish penal stations have been and are being\nreleased and returned to their homes, in accordance with Article VI of the\ntreaty. Negotiations are about to be had for defining the conventional\nrelations between the two countries, which fell into abeyance by reason of\nthe war. I trust that these will include a favorable arrangement for\ncommercial reciprocity under the terms of sections 3 and 4 of the current\ntariff act. In these, as in all matters of international concern, no effort\nwill be spared to respond to the good disposition of Spain, and to\ncultivate in all practicable ways the intimacy which should prevail between\ntwo nations whose past history has so often and in so many ways been marked\nby sincere friendship and by community of interests.</p>\n\n<p>I would recommend appropriate legislation in order to carry into execution\nArticle VII of the Treaty of Peace with Spain, by which the United States\nassured the payment of certain claims for indemnity of its citizens against\nSpain.</p>\n\n<p>The United States minister to Turkey continues, under instructions, to\npress for a money payment in satisfaction of the just claims for injuries\nsuffered by American citizens in the disorders of several years past and\nfor wrongs done to them by the Ottoman authorities. Some of these claims\nare of many years\' standing. This Government is hopeful of a general\nagreement in this regard.</p>\n\n<p>In the Turkish Empire the situation of our citizens remains unsatisfactory.\nOur efforts during nearly forty years to bring about a convention of\nnaturalization seem to be on the brink of final failure through the\nannounced policy of the Ottoman Porte to refuse recognition of the alien\nstatus of native Turkish subjects naturalized abroad since 1867. Our\nstatutes do not allow this Government to admit any distinction between the\ntreatment of native and naturalized Americans abroad, so that ceaseless\ncontroversy arises in cases where persons owing in the eye of international\nlaw a dual allegiance are prevented from entering Turkey or are expelled\nafter entrance. Our law in this regard contrasts with that of the European\nStates. The British act, for instance, does not claim effect for the\nnaturalization of an alien in the event of his return to his native\ncountry, unless the change be recognized by the law of that country or\nstipulated by treaty between it and the naturalizing State.</p>\n\n<p>The arbitrary treatment, in some instances, of American productions in\nTurkey has attracted attention of late, notably in regard to our flour.\nLarge shipments by the recently opened direct steamship line to Turkish\nports have been denied entrance on the score that, although of standard\ncomposition and unquestioned purity, the flour was pernicious to health\nbecause of deficient "elasticity" as indicated by antiquated and\nuntrustworthy tests. Upon due protest by the American minister, and it\nappearing that the act was a virtual discrimination against our product,\nthe shipments in question were admitted. In these, as in all instances,\nwherever occurring, when American products may be subjected in a foreign\ncountry, upon specious pretexts, to discrimination compared with the like\nproducts of another country, this Government will use its earnest efforts\nto secure fair and equal treatment for its citizens and their goods.\nFailing this, it will not hesitate to apply whatever corrective may be\nprovided by the statutes.</p>\n\n<p>The International Commission of Arbitration, appointed under the\nAnglo-Venezuelan treaty of 1897, rendered an award on October 3 last,\nwhereby the boundary line between Venezuela and British Guiana is\ndetermined, thus ending a controversy which has existed for the greater\npart of the century. The award, as to which the arbitrators were unanimous,\nwhile not meeting the extreme contention of either party, gives to Great\nBritain a large share of the interior territory in dispute and to Venezuela\nthe entire mouth of the Orinoco, including Barima Point and the Caribbean\nlittoral for some distance to the eastward. The decision appears to be\nequally satisfactory to both parties.</p>\n\n<p>Venezuela has once more undergone a revolution. The insurgents, under\nGeneral Castro, after a sanguinary engagement in which they suffered much\nloss, rallied in the mountainous interior and advanced toward the capital.\nThe bulk of the army having sided with the movement, President Andrade\nquitted Caracas, where General Castro set up a provisional government with\nwhich our minister and the representatives of other powers entered into\ndiplomatic relations on the 20th of November, 1899.</p>\n\n<p>The fourth section of the Tariff Act approved July 24, 1897, appears to\nprovide only for commercial treaties which should be entered into by the\nPresident and also ratified by the Senate within two years from its\npassage. Owing to delays inevitable in negotiations of this nature, none of\nthe treaties initiated under that section could be concluded in time for\nratification by the Senate prior to its adjournment on the 4th of March\nlast. Some of the pending negotiations, however, were near conclusion at\nthat time, and the resulting conventions have since been signed by the\nplenipotentiaries. Others, within both the third and fourth sections of the\nact, are still under consideration. Acting under the constitutional power\nof the Executive in respect to treaties, I have deemed it my duty, while\nobserving the limitations of concession provided by the fourth section, to\nbring to a conclusion all pending negotiations, and submit them to the\nSenate for its advice and consent.</p>\n\n<p>Conventions of reciprocity have been signed during the Congressional recess\nwith Great Britain for the respective colonies of British Guiana, Barbados,\nBermuda, Jamaica, and Turks and Caicos Islands, and with the Republic of\nNicaragua.</p>\n\n<p>Important reciprocal conventions have also been concluded with France and\nwith the Argentine Republic.</p>\n\n<p>In my last annual message the progress noted in the work of the diplomatic\nand consular officers in collecting information as to the industries and\ncommerce of other countries, and in the care and promptitude with which\ntheir reports are printed and distributed, has continued during the past\nyear, with increasingly valuable results in suggesting new sources of\ndemand for American products and in pointing out the obstacles still to be\novercome in facilitating the remarkable expansion of our foreign trade. It\nwill doubtless be gratifying to Congress to learn that the various agencies\nof the Department of State are co-operating in these endeavors with a zeal\nand effectiveness which are not only receiving the cordial recognition of\nour business interests, but are exciting the emulation of other\nGovernments. In any rearrangement of the great and complicated work of\nobtaining official data of an economic character which Congress may\nundertake it is most important, in my judgment, that the results already\nsecured by the efforts of the Department of State should be carefully\nconsidered with a view to a judicious development and increased utility to\nour export trade.</p>\n\n<p>The interest taken by the various States forming the International Union of\nAmerican Republics in the work of its organic bureau is evidenced by the\nfact that for the first time since its creation in 1890 all the Republics\nof South and Central America are now represented in it.</p>\n\n<p>The unanimous recommendation of the International American Conference,\nproviding for the International Union of American Republics, stated that it\nshould continue in force during a term of ten years from the date of its\norganization, and no country becoming a member of the union should cease to\nbe a member until the end of said period of ten years, and unless twelve\nmonths before the expiration of said period a majority of the members of\nthe union had given to the Secretary of State of the United States official\nnotice of their wish to terminate the union at the end of its first period,\nthat the union should continue to be maintained for another period of ten\nyears, and thereafter, under the same conditions, for successive periods of\nten years each.</p>\n\n<p>The period for notification expired on July 14, 1899, without any of the\nmembers having given the necessary notice of withdrawal. Its maintenance is\ntherefore assured for the next ten years. In view of this fact and of the\nnumerous questions of general interest and common benefit to all of the\nRepublics of America, some of which were considered by the first\nInternational American Conference, but not finally settled, and others\nwhich have since then grown to importance, it would seem expedient that the\nvarious Republics constituting the Union should be invited to hold at an\nearly date another conference in the capital of one of the countries other\nthan the United States, which has already enjoyed this honor.</p>\n\n<p>The purely international character of the work being done by the bureau and\nthe appreciation of its value are further emphasized by the active\nco-operation which the various Governments of the Latin. American Republics\nand their diplomatic representatives in this capital are now exhibiting and\nthe zealous endeavors they are making to extend its field of usefulness, to\npromote through it commercial intercourse, and strengthen the bonds of\namity and confidence between its various members and the nations of this\ncontinent.</p>\n\n<p>The act to encourage the holding of the Pan-American Exposition on the\nNiagara frontier, within the county of Erie or Niagara, in the State of New\nYork, in the year 1901, was approved on March 3, 1899.</p>\n\n<p>This exposition, which will be held in the city of Buffalo, in the near\nvicinity of the great Niagara cataract, and within a day\'s journey of which\nreside 40, 000, 000 Of our people, will be confined entirely to the Western\nHemisphere. Satisfactory assurances have already been given by the\ndiplomatic representatives of Great Britain, Mexico, the Central and South\nAmerican Republics, and most of the States of the United States that these\ncountries and States will make an unique, interesting, and instructive\nexhibit, peculiarly illustrative of their material progress during the\ncentury which is about to close.</p>\n\n<p>The law provides an appropriation Of $500,000 for the purpose of making an\nexhibit at the exposition by the Government of the United States from its\nExecutive Departments and from the Smithsonian Institution and National\nMuseum, the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries, the Department\nof Labor, and the Bureau of the American Republics. To secure a complete\nand harmonious arrangement of this Government exhibit a board of management\nhas already been created, and charged with the selection, purchase,\npreparation, transportation, arrangement, and safe-keeping of the articles\nand materials to be exhibited. This board has been organized and has\nalready entered upon the performance of its duties, as provided for by the\nlaw.</p>\n\n<p>I have every reason to hope and believe that this exposition will tend more\nfirmly to cement the cordial relations between the nations on this\ncontinent.</p>\n\n<p>In accordance with an act of Congress approved December 21, 1898, and under\nthe auspices of the Philadelphia Commercial Museum, a most interesting and\nvaluable exposition of products and manufactures especially adapted to\nexport trade was held in Philadelphia from the 14th of September to the 1st\nof December, 1899. The representative character of the exhibits and the\nwidespread interest manifested in the special objects of the undertaking\nafford renewed encouragement to those who look confidently to the steady\ngrowth of our enlarged exportation of manufactured goods, which has been\nthe most remarkable fact in the economic development of the United States\nin recent years. A feature of this exposition which is likely to become of\npermanent and increasing utility to our industries is the collection of\nsamples of merchandise produced in various countries with special reference\nto particular markets, providing practical object lessons to United States\nmanufacturers as to qualities, styles, and prices of goods such as meet the\nspecial demands of consumers and may be exported with advantage.</p>\n\n<p>In connection with the exposition an International Commercial Congress was\nheld, upon the invitation of the Philadelphia Commercial Museum,\ntransmitted by the Department of State to the various foreign Governments,\nfor an exchange of information and opinions with the view to the promotion\nof international trade. This invitation met with general and cordial\nacceptance, and the Congress, which began its sessions at the exposition on\nthe 13th of October proved to be of great practical importance, from the\nfact that it developed a general recognition of the interdependence of\nnations in trade and a most gratifying spirit of accommodation with\nreference to the gradual removal of existing impediments to reciprocal\nrelations, without injury to the industrial interests of either party.</p>\n\n<p>In response to the invitation of His Majesty, the Emperor of Russia,\ndelegates from twenty-six countries were assembled at The Hague on the 18th\nof May, as members of a conference in the interest of peace. The commission\nfrom the United States consisted of the Hon. Andrew D. White, the Hon. Seth\nLow, the Hon. Stanford Newel, Captain Alfred T. Mahan, of the United States\nNavy, Captain William Crozier, of the United States Army, and the Hon.\nFrederick W. Holls, secretary. The occasion seemed to be opportune for the\nserious consideration of a plan for the pacific adjustment of international\ndifferences, a subject in which the American people have been deeply\ninterested for many years, and a definite project for a permanent\ninternational tribunal was included in the instructions to the delegates of\nthe United States.</p>\n\n<p>The final act of the conference includes conventions upon the amelioration\nof the laws and customs of war on land, the adaptation to maritime warfare\nof the principles of the Geneva Convention of 1864, and the extension of\njudicial methods to international cases. The Convention for the Pacific\nSettlement of International Conflicts embodies the leading features of the\nAmerican plan, with such modifications as were rendered necessary by the\ngreat diversity of views and interests represented by the delegates. The\nfour titles of the convention provide for the maintenance of general peace,\nthe exercise of good offices and mediation, the formation of commissions of\ninquiry, and international arbitration.</p>\n\n<p>The mediation provided for by the convention is purely voluntary and\nadvisory, and is intended to avoid any invasion or limitation of the\nsovereign rights of the adhering States. The commissions of inquiry\nproposed consists of delegations to be specifically constituted for\nparticular purposes by means of conventions between the contesting parties,\nhaving for their object the clear understanding of international\ndifferences before resorting to the use of force. The provision for\narbitration contemplates the formation of a permanent tribunal before which\ndisputed cases may be brought for settlement by the mutual consent of the\nlitigants in each separate case. The advantages of such a permanent\ntribunal over impromptu commissions of arbitration are conceived to be the\nactual existence of a competent court, prepared to administer justice, the\ngreater economy resulting from a well-devised system, and the accumulated\njudicial skill and experience which such a tribunal would soon possess.</p>\n\n<p>While earnestly promoting the idea of establishing a permanent\ninternational tribunal, the delegation of the United States was not\nunmindful of the inconveniences which might arise from an obtrusive\nexercise of mediation, and in signing the convention carefully guarded the\nhistoric position of the United States by the following declaration:\nNothing contained in this convention shall be so construed as to require\nthe United States of America to depart from its traditional policy of not\nintruding upon, interfering with, or entangling itself in the political\nquestions or policy or internal administration of any foreign state; nor\nshall anything contained in the said convention be construed to imply a\nrelinquishment by the United. States of America of its traditional attitude\ntoward purely American questions. Thus interpreted, the Convention for the\nPacific Settlement of International Conflicts may be regarded as realizing\nthe earnest desire of great numbers of American citizens, whose deep sense\nof justice, expressed in numerous resolutions and memorials, has urged them\nto labor for this noble achievement. The general character of this\nconvention, already signed by the delegates of more than twenty sovereign\nStates, further commends it to the favorable action of the Senate of the\nUnited States, whose ratification it still awaits.</p>\n\n<p>Since my last annual message, and in obedience to the acts of the Congress\nof April 22 and 26, 1898, the remaining volunteer force enlisted for the\nSpanish War, consisting Of 34,834 regulars and 110,202 volunteers, with\nover 5,000 volunteer officers, has been discharged from the military\nservice. Of the volunteers, 667 officers and 14,831 men were serving in the\nPhilippines, and 1,650 of the regulars, who were entitled to be mustered\nout after the ratification of the treaty of peace. They voluntarily\nremained at the front until their places could be filled by new troops.\nThey were returned home in the order in which they went to Manila, and are\nnow all of them out of the service and in the ranks of citizenship. I\nrecommend that the Congress provide a special medal of honor for the\nvolunteers, regulars, sailors, and marines on duty in the Philippines who\nvoluntarily remained in the service after their terms of enlistment had\nexpired.</p>\n\n<p>By the act of March 2, 1899, Congress gave authority to increase the\nRegular Army to a maximum not exceeding 65,000 enlisted men, and to enlist\na force of 5,000 volunteers, to be recruited from the country at large. By\nvirtue of this authority the Regular Army has been increased to the number\nof 61,999 enlisted men and 2,248 officers, and new volunteer regiments have\nbeen organized aggregating 33,050 enlisted men and 1,524 officers. Two of\nthese volunteer regiments are made up of colored men, with colored line\nofficers. The new troops to take the places of those returning from the\nPhilippines have been transported to Manila to the number of 581 officers\nand 26,322 enlisted men of the Regular Army and 594 officers and 15,388\nenlisted men of the new volunteer force, while 504 officers and 14, 119 men\nof the volunteer force are on the ocean en route to Manila.</p>\n\n<p>The force now in Manila consists Of 905 officers and 30,578 regulars, and\n594 officers and 15,388 of the volunteers, making an aggregate of 1,499\nofficers and 45,966 men. When the troops now under orders shall reach\nManila the force in the archipelago will comprise 2,051 officers and 63,483\nmen. The muster out of the great volunteer army organized for the Spanish\nWar and the creation of a new army, the transportation from Manila to San\nFrancisco of those entitled to discharge and the transportation of the new\ntroops to take their places have been a work of great magnitude well and\nably done, for which too much credit cannot be given the War Department.</p>\n\n<p>During the past year we have reduced our force in Cuba and Puerto Rico, In\nCuba we now have 334 officers and 10,796 enlisted men; In Puerto Rico, 87\nofficers and 2,855 enlisted men and a battalion of 400 men composed of\nnative Puerto Ricans; while stationed throughout the United States are 910\nofficers and 17,317 men, and in Hawaii 12 officers and 453 enlisted men.</p>\n\n<p>The operations of the Army are fully presented in the report of the\nSecretary of War. I cannot withhold from officers and men the highest\ncommendation for their soldierly conduct in trying situations, their\nwilling sacrifices for their country, and the integrity and ability with\nwhich they have performed unusual and difficult duties in our island\npossessions.</p>\n\n<p>In the organization of the volunteer regiments authorized by the act of\nMarch 2, 1899, it was found that no provision had been made for chaplains.\nThis omission was doubtless from inadvertence. I recommend the early\nauthorization for the appointment of one chaplain for each of said\nregiments. These regiments are now in the Philippines, and it is important\nthat immediate action be had.</p>\n\n<p>In restoring peaceful conditions, orderly rule, and civic progress in Cuba,\nPuerto Rico, and, so far as practicable, in the Philippines, the\nrehabilitation of the postal service has been an essential and important\npart of the work. It became necessary to provide mail facilities both for\nour forces of occupation and for the native population. To meet this\nrequirement has involved a substantial reconstruction. The existing systems\nwere so fragmentary, defective, and inadequate that a new and comprehensive\norganization had to be created. American trained officials have been\nassigned to the directing and executive positions, while natives have been\nchiefly employed in making up the body of the force. In working out this\nplan the merit rule has been rigorously and faithfully applied.</p>\n\n<p>The appointment of Director-General of Posts of Cuba was given to an expert\nwho had been Chief Post-Office Inspector and Assistant Postmaster-General,\nand who united large experience with administrative capacity. For the\npostmastership at Havana the range of skilled and available men was\nscanned, and the choice fell upon one who had been twenty years in the\nservice as deputy postmaster and postmaster of a large city. This principle\ngoverned and determined the selection of the American officials sent not\nonly to Cuba, but to Puerto Rico and the Philippines, and they were\ninstructed to apply it so far as practicable in the employment of the\nnatives as minor postmasters and clerks. The postal system in Cuba, though\nremaining under the general guidance of the Postmaster-General, was made\nessentially independent. It was felt that it should not be a burden upon\nthe postal service of the United States, and provision was made that any\ndeficit in the postal revenue should be a charge upon the general revenues\nof the island.</p>\n\n<p>Though Puerto Rico and the Philippines hold a different relation to the\nUnited States, yet, for convenience of administration, the same principle\nof an autonomous system has been extended to them. The development of the\nservice in all of the islands has been rapid and successful. It has moved\nforward on American lines, with free delivery, money order, and registry\nsystems, and has given the people mail facilities far greater and more\nreliable than any they have ever before enjoyed. It is thus not only a\nvital agency of industrial, social, and business progress, but an important\ninfluence in diffusing a just understanding of the true spirit and\ncharacter of American administration.</p>\n\n<p>The domestic postal service continues to grow with extraordinary rapidity.\nThe expenditures and the revenues will each exceed $100,000,000 during the\ncurrent year. Fortunately, since the revival of prosperous times the\nrevenues have grown much faster than the expenditures, and there is every\nindication that a short period will witness the obliteration of the annual\ndeficit. In this connection the report of the Postmaster-General embodies a\nstatement of some evils which have grown up outside of the contemplation of\nlaw in the treatment of some classes of mail matter which wrongly exercise\nthe privilege of the pound rate, and shows that if this matter had been\nproperly classified and had paid the rate which it should have paid,\ninstead of a postal deficit for the last fiscal year of $6,610,000, there\nwould have been on one basis a surplus of $17,637,570, and on another Of\n$5,733,836. The reform thus suggested, in the opinion of the\nPostmaster-General, would not only put the postal service at once on a\nself-sustaining basis, but would permit great and valuable improvements,\nand I commend the subject to the consideration of the Congress.</p>\n\n<p>The Navy has maintained the spirit and high efficiency which have always\ncharacterized that service, and has lost none of the gallantry in heroic\naction which has signalized its brilliant and glorious past. The Nation has\nequal pride in its early and later achievements. Its habitual readiness for\nevery emergency has won the confidence and admiration of the country. The\npeople are interested in the continued preparation and prestige of the Navy\nand will justify liberal appropriations for its maintenance and\nimprovement. The officers have shown peculiar adaptation for the\nperformance of new and delicate duties which our recent war has imposed.</p>\n\n<p>It cannot be doubted that Congress will at once make necessary provision\nfor the armor plate for the vessels now under contract and building. Its\nattention is respectfully called to the report of the Secretary of the\nNavy, in which the subject is fully presented. I unite in his\nrecommendation that the Congress enact such special legislation as may be\nnecessary to enable the Department to make contracts early in the coming\nyear for armor of the best quality that can be obtained in this country for\nthe Maine, Ohio, and Missouri, and that the provision of the act of March\n3, 1899, limiting the price of armor to $300 per ton be removed.</p>\n\n<p>In the matter of naval construction Italy and Japan, of the great powers,\nlaid down less tonnage in the year 1899 than this country, and Italy alone\nhas less tonnage under construction. I heartily concur in the\nrecommendations for the increase of the Navy, as suggested by the\nSecretary.</p>\n\n<p>Our future progress and prosperity depend upon our ability to equal, if not\nsurpass, other nations in the enlargement and advance of science, industry,\nand commerce. To invention we must turn as one of the most powerful aids to\nthe accomplishment of such a result. The attention of the Congress is\ndirected to the report of the Commissioner of Patents, in which will be\nfound valuable suggestions and recommendations.</p>\n\n<p>On the 30th of June, 1899, the pension roll of the United States numbered\n991,519. These include the pensioners of the Army and Navy in all our wars.\nThe number added to the rolls during the year was 40,991. The number\ndropped by reason of death, remarriage, minors by legal limitation, failure\nto claim within three years, and other causes, was 43, 186, and the number\nof claims disallowed was 107,919. During the year 89,054 pension\ncertificates were issued, of which 37,077 were for new or original\npensions. The amount disbursed for army and navy pensions during the year\nwas $138,355,052.95, which was $1,651,461.61 less than the sum of the\nappropriations.</p>\n\n<p>The Grand Army of the Republic at its recent national encampment held in\nPhiladelphia has brought to my attention and to that of the Congress the\nwisdom and justice of a modification of the third section of the act of\nJune 27, 1890, which provides pensions for the widows of officers and\nenlisted men who served ninety days or more during the War of the Rebellion\nand were honorably discharged, provided that such widows are without other\nmeans of sup, port than their daily labor and were married to the soldier,\nsailor, or marine on account of whose service they claim pension prior to\nthe date of the act.</p>\n\n<p>The present holding of the Department is that if the widow\'s income aside\nfrom her daily labor does not exceed in amount what her pension would be,\nto wit, $96 per annum, she would be deemed to be without other means of\nsupport than her daily labor, and would be entitled to a pension under this\nact; while if the widow\'s income independent of the amount received by her\nas the result of her daily labor exceeds $96, she would not be pensionable\nunder the act. I am advised by the Commissioner of Pensions that the amount\nof the income allowed before title to pension would be barred has varied\nwidely under different administrations of the Pension Office, as well as\nduring different periods of the same administration, and has been the cause\nof just complaint and criticism.</p>\n\n<p>With the approval of the Secretary of the Interior the Commissioner of\nPensions recommends that, in order to make the practice at all times\nuniform and to do justice to the dependent widow, the amount of income\nallowed independent of the proceeds of her daily labor should be not less\nthan $250 per annum, and he urges that the Congress shall so amend the act\nas to permit the Pension Office to grant pensionable status to widows under\nthe terms of the third section of the act of June 27, 1890, whose income\naside from the proceeds of daily labor is not in excess of $250 per annum.\nI believe this to be a simple act of justice and heartily recommend it.</p>\n\n<p>The Dawes Commission reports that gratifying progress has been made in its\nwork during the preceding year. The field-work of enrollment of four of the\nnations has been completed. I recommend that Congress at an early day make\nliberal appropriation for educational purposes in the Indian Territory.</p>\n\n<p>In accordance with the act of Congress approved March 3, 1899. the\npreliminary work in connection with the Twelfth Census is now fully under\nway. The officers required for the proper administration of the duties\nimposed have been selected. The provision for securing a proper enumeration\nof the population, as well as to secure evidence of the industrial growth\nof the Nation, is broader and more comprehensive than any similar\nlegislation in the past. The Director advises that every needful effort is\nbeing made to push this great work to completion in the time limited by the\nstatute. It is believed that the Twelfth Census will emphasize our\nremarkable advance in all that pertains to national progress.</p>\n\n<p>Under the authority of the act of Congress approved July 7, 1898, the\ncommission consisting of the Secretary of the Treasury, the\nAttorney-General, and the Secretary of the Interior has made an agreement\nof settlement, which has had my approval, of the indebtedness to the\nGovernment growing out of the issue of bonds to aid in the construction of\nthe Central Pacific and Western Pacific railroads. The agreement secures\nto the Government the principal and interest of said bonds, amounting to\n$58,812,715.48. There has been paid thereon $11,762,543.12, which has been\ncovered into the Treasury, and the remainder, payable within ten years,\nwith interest at the rate Of 3 per cent per annum, payable semiannually, is\nsecured by the deposit of an equal amount of first-mortgage bonds of the\nPacific Railway companies. The amounts paid and secured to be paid to the\nGovernment on account of the Pacific Railroad subsidy claims are: Union\nPacific, cash - $58,448,223.75</p>\n\n<p>Kansas Pacific, cash - 6,303,000.00</p>\n\n<p>Central and Western Pacific, cash - 11,798,314.14</p>\n\n<p>Notes, secured - 47,050,172.36</p>\n\n<p>Kansas Pacific--dividends for deficiency due United States, cash -\n821,897.70 -\n</p>\n\t\t\t<div class="textNav"><a href="#top">^ Return to top</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>\n\t<div id="footer"><strong><em>State of the Union</em></strong> is a project\n\t\tby Brad Borevitz at <a href="http://www.onetwothree.net">onetwothree.net</a></div>\n</div>\n<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">\n</script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n_uacct = "UA-410742-1";\nurchinTracker();\n</script>\n</body>\n<!-- InstanceEnd -->\n</html>\n'
