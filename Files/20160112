And for this final one, I\'m going to try to make it shorter.\nI know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa.</p>\n\n<p>I also understand that because it\'s an election season, expectations for\nwhat we\'ll achieve this year are low. Still, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate\nthe constructive approach you and the other leaders took at the end of\nlast year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working\nfamilies. So I hope we can work together this year on bipartisan\npriorities like criminal justice reform, and helping people who are\nbattling prescription drug abuse. We just might surprise the cynics\nagain.</p>\n\n<p>But tonight, I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for\nthe year ahead. Don\'t worry, I\'ve got plenty, from helping students\nlearn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for\npatients. And I\'ll keep pushing for progress on the work that still\nneeds doing. Fixing a broken immigration system. Protecting our kids\nfrom gun violence. Equal pay for equal work, paid leave, raising the\nminimum wage. All these things still matter to hardworking families;\nthey are still the right thing to do; and I will not let up until they\nget done.</p>\n\n<p>But for my final address to this chamber, I don\'t want to talk just\nabout the next year. I want to focus on the next five years, ten years,\nand beyond.</p>\n\n<p>I want to focus on our future.</p>\n\n<p>We live in a time of extraordinary change, change that\'s reshaping the\nway we live, the way we work, our planet and our place in the world.\nIt\'s change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs, but also\neconomic disruptions that strain working families. It promises education\nfor girls in the most remote villages, but also connects terrorists\nplotting an ocean away. It\'s change that can broaden opportunity, or\nwiden inequality. And whether we like it or not, the pace of this change\nwill only accelerate.</p>\n\n<p>America has been through big changes before wars and depression, the\ninflux of immigrants, workers fighting for a fair deal, and movements to\nexpand civil rights. Each time, there have been those who told us to\nfear the future; who claimed we could slam the brakes on change,\npromising to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that\nwas threatening America under control. And each time, we overcame those\nfears. We did not, in the words of Lincoln, adhere to the "dogmas of the\nquiet past." Instead we thought anew, and acted anew. We made change\nwork for us, always extending America\'s promise outward, to the next\nfrontier, to more and more people. And because we did because we saw\nopportunity where others saw only peril we emerged stronger and better\nthan before.</p>\n\n<p>What was true then can be true now. Our unique strengths as a nation our\noptimism and work ethic, our spirit of discovery and innovation, our\ndiversity and commitment to the rule of law these things give us\neverything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to\ncome.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, it\'s that spirit that made the progress of these past seven\nyears possible. It\'s how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in\ngenerations. It\'s how we reformed our health care system, and reinvented\nour energy sector; how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops\nand veterans, and how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the\nperson we love.</p>\n\n<p>But such progress is not inevitable. It is the result of choices we make\ntogether. And we face such choices right now. Will we respond to the\nchanges of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation, and turning\nagainst each other as a people? Or will we face the future with\nconfidence in who we are, what we stand for, and the incredible things\nwe can do together?</p>\n\n<p>So let\'s talk about the future, and four big questions that we as a\ncountry have to answer regardless of who the next President is, or who\ncontrols the next Congress.</p>\n\n<p>First, how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security\nin this new economy?</p>\n\n<p>Second, how do we make technology work for us, and not against us\nespecially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate\nchange?</p>\n\n<p>Third, how do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming\nits policeman?</p>\n\n<p>And finally, how can we make our politics reflect what\'s best in us, and\nnot what\'s worst?</p>\n\n<p>Let me start with the economy, and a basic fact: the United States of\nAmerica, right now, has the strongest, most durable economy in the\nworld. We\'re in the middle of the longest streak of private-sector job\ncreation in history. More than 14 million new jobs; the strongest two\nyears of job growth since the \'90s; an unemployment rate cut in half.\nOur auto industry just had its best year ever. Manufacturing has created\nnearly 900,000 new jobs in the past six years. And we\'ve done all this\nwhile cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone claiming that America\'s economy is in decline is peddling\nfiction. What is true and the reason that a lot of Americans feel\nanxious is that the economy has been changing in profound ways, changes\nthat started long before the Great Recession hit and haven\'t let up.\nToday, technology doesn\'t just replace jobs on the assembly line, but\nany job where work can be automated. Companies in a global economy can\nlocate anywhere, and face tougher competition. As a result, workers have\nless leverage for a raise. Companies have less loyalty to their\ncommunities. And more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the\nvery top.</p>\n\n<p>All these trends have squeezed workers, even when they have jobs; even\nwhen the economy is growing. It\'s made it harder for a hardworking\nfamily to pull itself out of poverty, harder for young people to start\non their careers, and tougher for workers to retire when they want to.\nAnd although none of these trends are unique to America, they do offend\nour uniquely American belief that everybody who works hard should get a\nfair shot.</p>\n\n<p>For the past seven years, our goal has been a growing economy that works\nbetter for everybody. We\'ve made progress. But we need to make more. And\ndespite all the political arguments we\'ve had these past few years,\nthere are some areas where Americans broadly agree.</p>\n\n<p>We agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the\neducation and training they need to land a good-paying job. The\nbipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start, and\ntogether, we\'ve increased early childhood education, lifted high school\ngraduation rates to new highs, and boosted graduates in fields like\nengineering. In the coming years, we should build on that progress, by\nproviding Pre-K for all, offering every student the hands-on computer\nscience and math classes that make them job-ready on day one, and we\nshould recruit and support more great teachers for our kids.</p>\n\n<p>And we have to make college affordable for every American. Because no\nhardworking student should be stuck in the red. We\'ve already reduced\nstudent loan payments to ten percent of a borrower\'s income. Now, we\'ve\nactually got to cut the cost of college. Providing two years of\ncommunity college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the\nbest ways to do that, and I\'m going to keep fighting to get that started\nthis year.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, a great education isn\'t all we need in this new economy. We\nalso need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of\nsecurity. After all, it\'s not much of a stretch to say that some of the\nonly people in America who are going to work the same job, in the same\nplace, with a health and retirement package, for 30 years, are sitting\nin this chamber. For everyone else, especially folks in their forties\nand fifties, saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has\ngotten a lot tougher. Americans understand that at some point in their\ncareers, they may have to retool and retrain. But they shouldn\'t lose\nwhat they\'ve already worked so hard to build.</p>\n\n<p>That\'s why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever; we\nshouldn\'t weaken them, we should strengthen them. And for Americans\nshort of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as\neverything else is today. That\'s what the Affordable Care Act is all\nabout. It\'s about filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when\nwe lose a job, or go back to school, or start that new business, we\'ll\nstill have coverage. Nearly eighteen million have gained coverage so\nfar. Health care inflation has slowed. And our businesses have created\njobs every single month since it became law.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I\'m guessing we won\'t agree on health care anytime soon. But there\nshould be other ways both parties can improve economic security. Say a\nhardworking American loses his job we shouldn\'t just make sure he can\nget unemployment insurance; we should make sure that program encourages\nhim to retrain for a business that\'s ready to hire him. If that new job\ndoesn\'t pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place\nso that he can still pay his bills. And even if he\'s going from job to\njob, he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings\nwith him. That\'s the way we make the new economy work better for\neveryone.</p>\n\n<p>I also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling\npoverty. America is about giving everybody willing to work a hand up,\nand I\'d welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all\nsupport, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers without kids.</p>\n\n<p>But there are other areas where it\'s been more difficult to find\nagreement over the last seven years namely what role the government\nshould play in making sure the system\'s not rigged in favor of the\nwealthiest and biggest corporations. And here, the American people have\na choice to make.</p>\n\n<p>I believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy. I\nthink there are outdated regulations that need to be changed, and\nthere\'s red tape that needs to be cut. But after years of record\ncorporate profits, working families won\'t get more opportunity or bigger\npaychecks by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own\nrules at the expense of everyone else; or by allowing attacks on\ncollective bargaining to go unanswered. Food Stamp recipients didn\'t\ncause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did. Immigrants\naren\'t the reason wages haven\'t gone up enough; those decisions are made\nin the boardrooms that too often put quarterly earnings over long-term\nreturns. It\'s sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids\npaying taxes through offshore accounts. In this new economy, workers and\nstart-ups and small businesses need more of a voice, not less. The rules\nshould work for them. And this year I plan to lift up the many\nbusinesses who\'ve figured out that doing right by their workers ends up\nbeing good for their shareholders, their customers, and their\ncommunities, so that we can spread those best practices across America.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative.\nThis brings me to the second big question we have to answer as a\ncountry: how do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our\nbiggest challenges?</p>\n\n<p>Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn\'t deny\nSputnik was up there. We didn\'t argue about the science, or shrink our\nresearch and development budget. We built a space program almost\novernight, and twelve years later, we were walking on the moon.</p>\n\n<p>That spirit of discovery is in our DNA. We\'re Thomas Edison and the\nWright Brothers and George Washington Carver. We\'re Grace Hopper and\nKatherine Johnson and Sally Ride. We\'re every immigrant and entrepreneur\nfrom Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley racing to shape a better world.\nAnd over the past seven years, we\'ve nurtured that spirit.</p>\n\n<p>We\'ve protected an open internet, and taken bold new steps to get more\nstudents and low-income Americans online. We\'ve launched next-generation\nmanufacturing hubs, and online tools that give an entrepreneur\neverything he or she needs to start a business in a single day.</p>\n\n<p>But we can do so much more. Last year, Vice President Biden said that\nwith a new moonshot, America can cure cancer. Last month, he worked with\nthis Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health\nthe strongest resources they\'ve had in over a decade. Tonight, I\'m\nannouncing a new national effort to get it done. And because he\'s gone\nto the mat for all of us, on so many issues over the past forty years,\nI\'m putting Joe in charge of Mission Control. For the loved ones we\'ve\nall lost, for the family we can still save, let\'s make America the\ncountry that cures cancer once and for all.</p>\n\n<p>Medical research is critical. We need the same level of commitment when\nit comes to developing clean energy sources.</p>\n\n<p>Look, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate\nchange, have at it. You\'ll be pretty lonely, because you\'ll be debating\nour military, most of America\'s business leaders, the majority of the\nAmerican people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations\naround the world who agree it\'s a problem and intend to solve it.</p>\n\n<p>But even if the planet wasn\'t at stake; even if 2014 wasn\'t the warmest\nyear on record until 2015 turned out even hotter why would we want to\npass up the chance for American businesses to produce and sell the\nenergy of the future?</p>\n\n<p>Seven years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean energy\nin our history. Here are the results. In fields from Iowa to Texas, wind\npower is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power. On rooftops from\nArizona to New York, solar is saving Americans tens of millions of\ndollars a year on their energy bills, and employs more Americans than\ncoal in jobs that pay better than average. We\'re taking steps to give\nhomeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy something\nenvironmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support. Meanwhile,\nwe\'ve cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly sixty percent, and cut\ncarbon pollution more than any other country on Earth.</p>\n\n<p>Gas under two bucks a gallon ain\'t bad, either.</p>\n\n<p>Now we\'ve got to accelerate the transition away from dirty energy.\nRather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future\nespecially in communities that rely on fossil fuels. That\'s why I\'m\ngoing to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so\nthat they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our\nplanet. That way, we put money back into those communities and put tens\nof thousands of Americans to work building a 21st century transportation\nsystem.</p>\n\n<p>None of this will happen overnight, and yes, there are plenty of\nentrenched interests who want to protect the status quo. But the jobs\nwe\'ll create, the money we\'ll save, and the planet we\'ll preserve that\'s\nthe kind of future our kids and grandkids deserve.</p>\n\n<p>Climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked\nto the rest of the world. And that\'s why the third big question we have\nto answer is how to keep America safe and strong without either\nisolating ourselves or trying to nation-build everywhere there\'s a\nproblem.</p>\n\n<p>I told you earlier all the talk of America\'s economic decline is\npolitical hot air. Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our\nenemies getting stronger and America getting weaker. The United States\nof America is the most powerful nation on Earth. Period. It\'s not even\nclose. We spend more on our military than the next eight nations\ncombined. Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the\nworld. No nation dares to attack us or our allies because they know\nthat\'s the path to ruin. Surveys show our standing around the world is\nhigher than when I was elected to this office, and when it comes to\nevery important international issue, people of the world do not look to\nBeijing or Moscow to lead they call us.</p>\n\n<p>As someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know\nthis is a dangerous time. But that\'s not because of diminished American\nstrength or some looming superpower. In today\'s world, we\'re threatened\nless by evil empires and more by failing states. The Middle East is\ngoing through a transformation that will play out for a generation,\nrooted in conflicts that date back millennia. Economic headwinds blow\nfrom a Chinese economy in transition. Even as their economy contracts,\nRussia is pouring resources to prop up Ukraine and Syria states they see\nslipping away from their orbit. And the international system we built\nafter World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s up to us to help remake that system. And that means we have to set\npriorities.</p>\n\n<p>Priority number one is protecting the American people and going after\nterrorist networks. Both al Qaeda and now ISIL pose a direct threat to\nour people, because in today\'s world, even a handful of terrorists who\nplace no value on human life, including their own, can do a lot of\ndamage. They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside\nour country; they undermine our allies.</p>\n\n<p>But as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is\nWorld War III just play into their hands. Masses of fighters on the back\nof pickup trucks and twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages\npose an enormous danger to civilians and must be stopped. But they do\nnot threaten our national existence. That\'s the story ISIL wants to\ntell; that\'s the kind of propaganda they use to recruit. We don\'t need\nto build them up to show that we\'re serious, nor do we need to push away\nvital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is\nrepresentative of one of the world\'s largest religions. We just need to\ncall them what they are killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out,\nhunted down, and destroyed.</p>\n\n<p>That\'s exactly what we are doing. For more than a year, America has led\na coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISIL\'s financing,\ndisrupt their plots, stop the flow of terrorist fighters, and stamp out\ntheir vicious ideology. With nearly 10,000 air strikes, we are taking\nout their leadership, their oil, their training camps, and their\nweapons. We are training, arming, and supporting forces who are steadily\nreclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria.</p>\n\n<p>If this Congress is serious about winning this war, and wants to send a\nmessage to our troops and the world, you should finally authorize the\nuse of military force against ISIL. Take a vote. But the American people\nshould know that with or without Congressional action, ISIL will learn\nthe same lessons as terrorists before them. If you doubt America\'s\ncommitment or mine to see that justice is done, ask Osama bin Laden. Ask\nthe leader of al Qaeda in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the\nperpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell. When you\ncome after Americans, we go after you. It may take time, but we have\nlong memories, and our reach has no limit.</p>\n\n<p>Our foreign policy must be focused on the threat from ISIL and al Qaeda,\nbut it can\'t stop there. For even without ISIL, instability will\ncontinue for decades in many parts of the world in the Middle East, in\nAfghanistan and Pakistan, in parts of Central America, Africa and Asia.\nSome of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks;\nothers will fall victim to ethnic conflict, or famine, feeding the next\nwave of refugees. The world will look to us to help solve these\nproblems, and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to\ncarpet bomb civilians. That may work as a TV sound bite, but it doesn\'t\npass muster on the world stage.</p>\n\n<p>We also can\'t try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into\ncrisis. That\'s not leadership; that\'s a recipe for quagmire, spilling\nAmerican blood and treasure that ultimately weakens us. It\'s the lesson\nof Vietnam, of Iraq and we should have learned it by now.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, there\'s a smarter approach, a patient and disciplined\nstrategy that uses every element of our national power. It says America\nwill always act, alone if necessary, to protect our people and our\nallies; but on issues of global concern, we will mobilize the world to\nwork with us, and make sure other countries pull their own weight.</p>\n\n<p>That\'s our approach to conflicts like Syria, where we\'re partnering with\nlocal forces and leading international efforts to help that broken\nsociety pursue a lasting peace.</p>\n\n<p>That\'s why we built a global coalition, with sanctions and principled\ndiplomacy, to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. As we speak, Iran has rolled\nback its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and the\nworld has avoided another war.</p>\n\n<p>That\'s how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa. Our military,\nour doctors, and our development workers set up the platform that\nallowed other countries to join us in stamping out that epidemic.</p>\n\n<p>That\'s how we forged a Trans-Pacific Partnership to open markets,\nprotect workers and the environment, and advance American leadership in\nAsia. It cuts 18,000 taxes on products Made in America, and supports\nmore good jobs. With TPP, China doesn\'t set the rules in that region, we\ndo. You want to show our strength in this century? Approve this\nagreement. Give us the tools to enforce it.</p>\n\n<p>Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy, setting\nus back in Latin America. That\'s why we restored diplomatic relations,\nopened the door to travel and commerce, and positioned ourselves to\nimprove the lives of the Cuban people. You want to consolidate our\nleadership and credibility in the hemisphere? Recognize that the Cold\nWar is over. Lift the embargo.</p>\n\n<p>American leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between ignoring\nthe rest of the world except when we kill terrorists; or occupying and\nrebuilding whatever society is unraveling. Leadership means a wise\napplication of military power, and rallying the world behind causes that\nare right. It means seeing our foreign assistance as part of our\nnational security, not charity. When we lead nearly 200 nations to the\nmost ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change that helps\nvulnerable countries, but it also protects our children. When we help\nUkraine defend its democracy, or Colombia resolve a decades-long war,\nthat strengthens the international order we depend upon. When we help\nAfrican countries feed their people and care for the sick, that prevents\nthe next pandemic from reaching our shores. Right now, we are on track\nto end the scourge of HIV/AIDS, and we have the capacity to accomplish\nthe same thing with malaria something I\'ll be pushing this Congress to\nfund this year.</p>\n\n<p>That\'s strength. That\'s leadership. And that kind of leadership depends\non the power of our example. That is why I will keep working to shut\ndown the prison at Guantanamo: it\'s expensive, it\'s unnecessary, and it\nonly serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies.</p>\n\n<p>That\'s why we need to reject any politics that targets people because of\nrace or religion. This isn\'t a matter of political correctness. It\'s a\nmatter of understanding what makes us strong. The world respects us not\njust for our arsenal; it respects us for our diversity and our openness\nand the way we respect every faith. His Holiness, Pope Francis, told\nthis body from the very spot I stand tonight that "to imitate the hatred\nand violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their\nplace." When politicians insult Muslims, when a mosque is vandalized, or\na kid bullied, that doesn\'t make us safer. That\'s not telling it like it\nis. It\'s just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes\nit harder to achieve our goals. And it betrays who we are as a country.</p>\n\n<p>"We the People." Our Constitution begins with those three simple words,\nwords we\'ve come to recognize mean all the people, not just some; words\nthat insist we rise and fall together. That brings me to the fourth, and\nmaybe the most important thing I want to say tonight.</p>\n\n<p>The future we want opportunity and security for our families; a rising\nstandard of living and a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids all\nthat is within our reach. But it will only happen if we work together.\nIt will only happen if we can have rational, constructive debates.</p>\n\n<p>It will only happen if we fix our politics.</p>\n\n<p>A better politics doesn\'t mean we have to agree on everything. This is a\nbig country, with different regions and attitudes and interests. That\'s\none of our strengths, too. Our Founders distributed power between states\nand branches of government, and expected us to argue, just as they did,\nover the size and shape of government, over commerce and foreign\nrelations, over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security.</p>\n\n<p>But democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens. It\ndoesn\'t work if we think the people who disagree with us are all\nmotivated by malice, or that our political opponents are unpatriotic.\nDemocracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise; or when\neven basic facts are contested, and we listen only to those who agree\nwith us. Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get\nattention. Most of all, democracy breaks down when the average person\nfeels their voice doesn\'t matter; that the system is rigged in favor of\nthe rich or the powerful or some narrow interest.</p>\n\n<p>Too many Americans feel that way right now. It\'s one of the few regrets\nof my presidency that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has\ngotten worse instead of better. There\'s no doubt a president with the\ngifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide, and\nI guarantee I\'ll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office.</p>\n\n<p>But, my fellow Americans, this cannot be my task or any President\'s\nalone. There are a whole lot of folks in this chamber who would like to\nsee more cooperation, a more elevated debate in Washington, but feel\ntrapped by the demands of getting elected. I know; you\'ve told me. And\nif we want a better politics, it\'s not enough to just change a\nCongressman or a Senator or even a President; we have to change the\nsystem to reflect our better selves.</p>\n\n<p>We have to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so\nthat politicians can pick their voters, and not the other way around. We\nhave to reduce the influence of money in our politics, so that a handful\nof families and hidden interests can\'t bankroll our elections and if our\nexisting approach to campaign finance can\'t pass muster in the courts,\nwe need to work together to find a real solution. We\'ve got to make\nvoting easier, not harder, and modernize it for the way we live now. And\nover the course of this year, I intend to travel the country to push for\nreforms that do.</p>\n\n<p>But I can\'t do these things on my own. Changes in our political process\nin not just who gets elected but how they get elected that will only\nhappen when the American people demand it. It will depend on you. That\'s\nwhat\'s meant by a government of, by, and for the people.</p>\n\n<p>What I\'m asking for is hard. It\'s easier to be cynical; to accept that\nchange isn\'t possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our\nvoices and actions don\'t matter. But if we give up now, then we forsake\na better future. Those with money and power will gain greater control\nover the decisions that could send a young soldier to war, or allow\nanother economic disaster, or roll back the equal rights and voting\nrights that generations of Americans have fought, even died, to secure.\nAs frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to fall back into\ntribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don\'t look like us, or pray\nlike us, or vote like we do, or share the same background.</p>\n\n<p>We can\'t afford to go down that path. It won\'t deliver the economy we\nwant, or the security we want, but most of all, it contradicts\neverything that makes us the envy of the world.</p>\n\n<p>So, my fellow Americans, whatever you may believe, whether you prefer\none party or no party, our collective future depends on your willingness\nto uphold your obligations as a citizen. To vote. To speak out. To stand\nup for others, especially the weak, especially the vulnerable, knowing\nthat each of us is only here because somebody, somewhere, stood up for\nus. To stay active in our public life so it reflects the goodness and\ndecency and optimism that I see in the American people every single day.</p>\n\n<p>It won\'t be easy. Our brand of democracy is hard. But I can promise that\na year from now, when I no longer hold this office, I\'ll be right there\nwith you as a citizen inspired by those voices of fairness and vision,\nof grit and good humor and kindness that have helped America travel so\nfar. Voices that help us see ourselves not first and foremost as black\nor white or Asian or Latino, not as gay or straight, immigrant or native\nborn; not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans first, bound by\na common creed. Voices Dr. King believed would have the final word\nvoices of unarmed truth and unconditional love.</p>\n\n<p>They\'re out there, those voices. They don\'t get a lot of attention, nor\ndo they seek it, but they are busy doing the work this country needs\ndoing.</p>\n\n<p>I see them everywhere I travel in this incredible country of ours. I see\nyou. I know you\'re there. You\'re the reason why I have such incredible\nconfidence in our future. Because I see your quiet, sturdy citizenship\nall the time.</p>\n\n<p>I see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to\nkeep his company open, and the boss who pays him higher wages to keep\nhim on board.</p>\n\n<p>I see it in the Dreamer who stays up late to finish her science project,\nand the teacher who comes in early because he knows she might someday\ncure a disease.</p>\n\n<p>I see it in the American who served his time, and dreams of starting\nover and the business owner who gives him that second chance. The\nprotester determined to prove that justice matters, and the young cop\nwalking the beat, treating everybody with respect, doing the brave,\nquiet work of keeping us safe.</p>\n\n<p>I see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his\nbrothers, the nurse who tends to him \'til he can run a marathon, and the\ncommunity that lines up to cheer him on.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is, and the\nfather whose love for that son overrides everything he\'s been taught.</p>\n\n<p>I see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as\nlong as she has to; the new citizen who casts his for the first time;\nthe volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count, because\neach of them in different ways know how much that precious right is\nworth.</p>\n\n<p>That\'s the America I know. That\'s the country we love. Clear-eyed.\nBig-hearted. Optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will\nhave the final word. That\'s what makes me so hopeful about our future.\nBecause of you. I believe in you. That\'s why I stand here confident that\nthe State of our Union is strong.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\n</p>\n\t\t\t<div class="textNav"><a href="#top">^ Return to top</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>\n\t<div id="footer"><strong><em>State of the Union</em></strong> is a project\n\t\tby Brad Borevitz at <a href="http://www.onetwothree.net">onetwothree.net</a></div>\n</div>\n<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">\n</script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n_uacct = "UA-410742-1";\nurchinTracker();\n</script>\n</body>\n<!-- InstanceEnd -->\n</html>\n'
