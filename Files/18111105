and it was communicated through\nthe British envoy just arrived that whilst the revocation of the edicts of\nFrance, as officially made known to the British Government, was denied to\nhave taken place, it was an indispensable condition of the repeal of the\nBritish orders that commerce should be restored to a footing that would\nadmit the productions and manufactures of Great Britain, when owned by\nneutrals, into markets shut against them by her enemy, the United States\nbeing given to understand that in the mean time a continuance of their\nnonimportation act would lead to measures of retaliation.</p>\n\n<p>At a later date it has indeed appeared that a communication to the British\nGovernment of fresh evidence of the repeal of the French decrees against\nour neutral trade was followed by an intimation that it had been\ntransmitted to the British plenipotentiary here in order that it might\nreceive full consideration in the depending discussions. This communication\nappears not to have been received; but the transmission of it hither,\ninstead of founding on it an actual repeal of the orders or assurances that\nthe repeal would ensue, will not permit us to rely on any effective change\nin the British cabinet. To be ready to meet with cordiality satisfactory\nproofs of such a change, and to proceed in the mean time in adapting our\nmeasures to the views which have been disclosed through that minister will\nbest consult our whole duty.</p>\n\n<p>In the unfriendly spirit of those disclosures indemnity and redress for\nother wrongs have continued to be withheld, and our coasts and the mouths\nof our harbors have again witnessed scenes not less derogatory to the\ndearest of our national rights than vexation to the regular course of our\ntrade.</p>\n\n<p>Among the occurrences produced by the conduct of British ships of war\nhovering on our coasts was an encounter between one of them and the\nAmerican frigate commanded by Captain Rodgers, rendered unavoidable on the\npart of the latter by a fire commenced without cause by the former, whose\ncommander is therefore alone chargeable with the blood unfortunately shed\nin maintaining the honor of the American flag. The proceedings of a court\nof inquiry requested by Captain Rodgers are communicated, together with\nthe correspondence relating to the occurrence, between the Secretary of\nState and His Britannic Majesty\'s envoy. To these are added the several\ncorrespondences which have passed on the subject of the British orders in\ncouncil, and to both the correspondence relating to the Floridas, in which\nCongress will be made acquainted with the interposition which the\nGovernment of Great Britain has thought proper to make against the\nproceeding of the United States.</p>\n\n<p>The justice and fairness which have been evinced on the part of the United\nStates toward France, both before and since the revocation of her decrees,\nauthorized an expectation that her Government would have followed up that\nmeasure by all such others as were due to our reasonable claims, as well as\ndictated by its amicable professions. No proof, however, is yet given of an\nintention to repair the other wrongs done to the United States, and\nparticularly to restore the great amount of American property seized and\ncondemned under edicts which, though not affecting our neutral relations,\nand therefore not entering into questions between the United States and\nother belligerents, were nevertheless founded in such unjust principles\nthat the reparation ought to have been prompt and ample.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to this and other demands of strict right on that nation, the\nUnited States have much reason to be dissatisfied with the rigorous and\nunexpected restrictions to which their trade with the French dominions has\nbeen subjected, and which, if not discontinued, will require at least\ncorresponding restrictions on importations from France into the United\nStates.</p>\n\n<p>On all those subjects our minister plenipotentiary lately sent to Paris has\ncarried with him the necessary instructions, the result of which will be\ncommunicated to you, by ascertaining the ulterior policy of the French\nGovernment toward the United States, will enable you to adapt to it that of\nthe United States toward France.</p>\n\n<p>Our other foreign relations remain without unfavorable changes. With Russia\nthey are on the best footing of friendship. The ports of Sweden have\nafforded proofs of friendly dispositions toward our commerce in the\ncouncils of that nation also, and the information from our special minister\nto Denmark shews that the mission had been attended with valuable effects\nto our citizens, whose property had been so extensively violated and\nendangered by cruisers under the Danish flag.</p>\n\n<p>Under the ominous indications which commanded attention it became a duty to\nexert the means committed to the executive department in providing for the\ngeneral security. The works of defense on our maritime frontier have\naccordingly been prosecuted with an activity leaving little to be added for\nthe completion of the most important ones, and, as particularly suited for\ncooperation in emergencies, a portion of the gun boats have in particular\nharbors been ordered into use. The ships of war before in commission, with\nthe addition of a frigate, have been chiefly employed as a cruising guard\nto the rights of our coast, and such a disposition has been made of our\nland forces as was thought to promise the services most appropriate and\nimportant.</p>\n\n<p>In this disposition is included a force consisting of regulars and militia,\nembodied in the Indiana Territory and marched toward our northwestern\nfrontier. This measure was made requisite by several murders and\ndepredations committed by Indians, but more especially by the menacing\npreparations and aspect of a combination of them on the Wabash, under the\ninfluence and direction of a fanatic of the Shawanese tribe. With these\nexceptions the Indian tribes retain their peaceable dispositions toward us,\nand their usual pursuits.</p>\n\n<p>I must now add that the period is arrived which claims from the legislative\nguardians of the national rights a system of more ample provisions for\nmaintaining them. Notwithstanding the scrupulous justice, the protracted\nmoderation, and the multiplied efforts on the part of the United States to\nsubstitute for the accumulating dangers to the peace of the two countries\nall the mutual advantages of reestablished friendship and confidence, we\nhave seen that the British cabinet perseveres not only in withholding a\nremedy for other wrongs, so long and so loudly calling for it, but in the\nexecution, brought home to the threshold of our territory, of measures\nwhich under existing circumstances have the character as well as the effect\nof war on our lawful commerce.</p>\n\n<p>With this evidence of hostile inflexibility in trampling on rights which no\nindependent nation can relinquish, Congress will feel the duty of putting\nthe United States into an armor and an attitude demanded by the crisis, and\ncorresponding with the national spirit and expectations.</p>\n\n<p>I recommend, accordingly, that adequate provisions be made for filling the\nranks and prolonging the enlistments of the regular troops; for an\nauxiliary force to be engaged for a more limited term; for the acceptance\nof volunteer corps, whose patriotic ardor may court a participation in\nurgent services; for detachments as they may be wanted of other portions of\nthe militia, and for such a preparation of the great body as will\nproportion its usefulness to its intrinsic capacities. Nor can the occasion\nfail to remind you of the importance of those military seminaries which in\nevery event will form a valuable and frugal part of our military\nestablishment.</p>\n\n<p>The manufacture of cannon and small arms has proceeded with due success,\nand the stock and resources of all the necessary munitions are adequate to\nemergencies. It will not be inexpedient, however, for Congress to authorize\nan enlargement of them.</p>\n\n<p>Your attention will of course be drawn to such provisions on the subject of\nour naval force as may be required for the services to which it may be best\nadapted. I submit to Congress the seasonableness also of an authority to\naugment the stock of such materials as are imperishable in their nature, or\nmay not at once be attainable.</p>\n\n<p>In contemplating the scenes which distinguish this momentous epoch, and\nestimating their claims to our attention, it is impossible to overlook\nthose developing themselves among the great communities which occupy the\nsouthern portion of our own hemisphere and extend into our neighborhood. An\nenlarged philanthropy and an enlightened forecast concur in imposing on the\nnational councils an obligation to take a deep interest in their destinies,\nto cherish reciprocal sentiments of good will, to regard the progress of\nevents, and not to be unprepared for whatever order of things may be\nultimately established.</p>\n\n<p>Under another aspect of our situation the early attention of Congress will\nbe due to the expediency of further guards against evasions and infractions\nof our commercial laws. The practice of smuggling, which is odious\neverywhere, and particularly criminal in free governments, where, the laws\nbeing made by all for the good of all, a fraud is committed on every\nindividual as well as on the state, attains its utmost guilt when it blends\nwith a pursuit of ignominious gain a treacherous subserviency, in the\ntransgressors, to a foreign policy adverse to that of their own country. It\nis then that the virtuous indignation of the public should be enabled to\nmanifest itself through the regular animadversions of the most competent\nlaws.</p>\n\n<p>To secure greater respect to our mercantile flag, and to the honest\ninterests which it covers, it is expedient also that it be made punishable\nin our citizens to accept licenses from foreign governments for a trade\nunlawfully interdicted by them to other American citizens, or to trade\nunder false colors or papers of any sort.</p>\n\n<p>A prohibition is equally called for against the acceptance by our citizens\nof special licenses to be used in a trade with the United States, and\nagainst the admission into particular ports of the United States of vessels\nfrom foreign countries authorized to trade with particular ports only.</p>\n\n<p>Although other subjects will press more immediately on your deliberations,\na portion of them can not but be well bestowed on the just and sound policy\nof securing to our manufactures the success they have attained, and are\nstill attaining, in some degree, under the impulse of causes not permanent,\nand to our navigation, the fair extent of which is at present abridged by\nthe unequal regulations of foreign governments.</p>\n\n<p>Besides the reasonableness of saving our manufactures from sacrifices which\na change of circumstances might bring on them, the national interest\nrequires that, with regard to such articles at least as belong to our\ndefense and our primary wants, we should not be left in unnecessary\ndependence on external supplies. And whilst foreign governments adhere to\nthe existing discriminations in their ports against our navigation, and\nan equality or lesser discrimination is enjoyed by their navigation in\nour ports, the effect can not be mistaken, because it has been seriously\nfelt by our shipping interests; and in proportion as this takes place the\nadvantages of an independent conveyance of our products to foreign\nmarkets and of a growing body of mariners trained by their occupations for\nthe service of their country in times of danger must be diminished.</p>\n\n<p>The receipts into the Treasury during the year ending on the 30th day of\nSeptember last have exceeded $13.5 millions, and have enabled us to defray\nthe current expenses, including the interest on the public debt, and to\nreimburse more than $5 millions of the principal without recurring to the\nloan authorized by the act of the last session. The temporary loan\nobtained in the latter end of the year 1810 has also been reimbursed, and\nis not included in that amount.</p>\n\n<p>The decrease of revenue arising from the situation of our commerce, and the\nextraordinary expenses which have and may become necessary, must be taken\ninto view in making commensurate provisions for the ensuing year; and I\nrecommend to your consideration the propriety of insuring a sufficiency of\nannual revenue at least to defray the ordinary expenses of Government, and\nto pay the interest on the public debt, including that on new loans which\nmay be authorized.</p>\n\n<p>I can not close this communication without expressing my deep sense of the\ncrisis in which you are assembled, my confidence in a wise and honorable\nresult to your deliberations, and assurances of the faithful zeal with\nwhich my cooperating duties will be discharged, invoking at the same time\nthe blessing of Heaven on our beloved country and on all the means that may\nbe employed in vindicating its rights and advancing its welfare.\n</p>\n\t\t\t<div class="textNav"><a href="#top">^ Return to top</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>\n\t<div id="footer"><strong><em>State of the Union</em></strong> is a project\n\t\tby Brad Borevitz at <a href="http://www.onetwothree.net">onetwothree.net</a></div>\n</div>\n<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">\n</script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n_uacct = "UA-410742-1";\nurchinTracker();\n</script>\n</body>\n<!-- InstanceEnd -->\n</html>\n'
