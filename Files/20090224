And rightly so.  If you haven\'t been\npersonally affected by this recession, you probably know someone who has -- a\nfriend; a neighbor; a member of your family.  You don\'t need to hear another\nlist of statistics to know that our economy is in crisis, because you live it\nevery day.  It\'s the worry you wake up with and the source of sleepless\nnights.  It\'s the job you thought you\'d retire from but now have lost; the\nbusiness you built your dreams upon that\'s now hanging by a thread; the\ncollege acceptance letter your child had to put back in the envelope.  The\nimpact of this recession is real, and it is everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>But while our economy may be weakened and our confidence shaken; though we are\nliving through difficult and uncertain times, tonight I want every American to\nknow this:</p>\n\n<p>We will rebuild, we will recover, and the United States of America will emerge\nstronger than before.</p>\n\n<p>The weight of this crisis will not determine the destiny of this nation.  The\nanswers to our problems don\'t lie beyond our reach.  They exist in our\nlaboratories and universities; in our fields and our factories; in the\nimaginations of our entrepreneurs and the pride of the hardest-working people\non Earth.  Those qualities that have made America the greatest force of\nprogress and prosperity in human history we still possess in ample measure. \nWhat is required now is for this country to pull together, confront boldly the\nchallenges we face, and take responsibility for our future once more.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if we\'re honest with ourselves, we\'ll admit that for too long, we have\nnot always met these responsibilities -- as a government or as a people.  I\nsay this not to lay blame or look backwards, but because it is only by\nunderstanding how we arrived at this moment that we\'ll be able to lift\nourselves out of this predicament.</p>\n\n<p>The fact is, our economy did not fall into decline overnight.  Nor did all of\nour problems begin when the housing market collapsed or the stock market sank.\n We have known for decades that our survival depends on finding new sources of\nenergy.  Yet we import more oil today than ever before.  The cost of health\ncare eats up more and more of our savings each year, yet we keep delaying\nreform.  Our children will compete for jobs in a global economy that too many\nof our schools do not prepare them for.  And though all these challenges went\nunsolved, we still managed to spend more money and pile up more debt, both as\nindividuals and through our government, than ever before.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, we have lived through an era where too often, short-term gains\nwere prized over long-term prosperity; where we failed to look beyond the next\npayment, the next quarter, or the next election.  A surplus became an excuse\nto transfer wealth to the wealthy instead of an opportunity to invest in our\nfuture.  Regulations were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense\nof a healthy market.  People bought homes they knew they couldn\'t afford from\nbanks and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway.  And all the while,\ncritical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time on\nsome other day.</p>\n\n<p>Well that day of reckoning has arrived, and the time to take charge of our\nfuture is here.</p>\n\n<p>Now is the time to act boldly and wisely -- to not only revive this economy,\nbut to build a new foundation for lasting prosperity.  Now is the time to\njumpstart job creation, re-start lending, and invest in areas like energy,\nhealth care, and education that will grow our economy, even as we make hard\nchoices to bring our deficit down.  That is what my economic agenda is\ndesigned to do, and that\'s what I\'d like to talk to you about tonight.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s an agenda that begins with jobs.</p>\n\n<p>As soon as I took office, I asked this Congress to send me a recovery plan by\nPresident\'s Day that would put people back to work and put money in their\npockets.  Not because I believe in bigger government -- I don\'t.  Not because\nI\'m not mindful of the massive debt we\'ve inherited -- I am.  I called for\naction because the failure to do so would have cost more jobs and caused more\nhardships.  In fact, a failure to act would have worsened our long-term\ndeficit by assuring weak economic growth for years.  That\'s why I pushed for\nquick action.  And tonight, I am grateful that this Congress delivered, and\npleased to say that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is now law.</p>\n\n<p>Over the next two years, this plan will save or create 3.5 million jobs.  More\nthan 90% of these jobs will be in the private sector -- jobs rebuilding our\nroads and bridges; constructing wind turbines and solar panels; laying\nbroadband and expanding mass transit.</p>\n\n<p>Because of this plan, there are teachers who can now keep their jobs and\neducate our kids.  Health care professionals can continue caring for our sick.\n There are 57 police officers who are still on the streets of Minneapolis\ntonight because this plan prevented the layoffs their department was about to\nmake.</p>\n\n<p>Because of this plan, 95% of the working households in America will receive a\ntax cut -- a tax cut that you will see in your paychecks beginning on April\n1st.</p>\n\n<p>Because of this plan, families who are struggling to pay tuition costs will\nreceive a $2,500 tax credit for all four years of college.  And Americans who\nhave lost their jobs in this recession will be able to receive extended\nunemployment benefits and continued health care coverage to help them weather\nthis storm.</p>\n\n<p>I know there are some in this chamber and watching at home who are skeptical\nof whether this plan will work.  I understand that skepticism.  Here in\nWashington, we\'ve all seen how quickly good intentions can turn into broken\npromises and wasteful spending.  And with a plan of this scale comes enormous\nresponsibility to get it right.</p>\n\n<p>That is why I have asked Vice President Biden to lead a tough, unprecedented\noversight effort -- because nobody messes with Joe.  I have told each member\nof my Cabinet as well as mayors and governors across the country that they\nwill be held accountable by me and the American people for every dollar they\nspend.  I have appointed a proven and aggressive Inspector General to ferret\nout any and all cases of waste and fraud.  And we have created a new website\ncalled recovery.gov so that every American can find out how and where their\nmoney is being spent.</p>\n\n<p>So the recovery plan we passed is the first step in getting our economy back\non track.  But it is just the first step.  Because even if we manage this plan\nflawlessly, there will be no real recovery unless we clean up the credit\ncrisis that has severely weakened our financial system.</p>\n\n<p>I want to speak plainly and candidly about this issue tonight, because every\nAmerican should know that it directly affects you and your family\'s\nwell-being.  You should also know that the money you\'ve deposited in banks\nacross the country is safe; your insurance is secure; and you can rely on the\ncontinued operation of our financial system.  That is not the source of\nconcern.</p>\n\n<p>The concern is that if we do not re-start lending in this country, our\nrecovery will be choked off before it even begins.</p>\n\n<p>You see, the flow of credit is the lifeblood of our economy.  The ability to\nget a loan is how you finance the purchase of everything from a home to a car\nto a college education; how stores stock their shelves, farms buy equipment,\nand businesses make payroll.</p>\n\n<p>But credit has stopped flowing the way it should.  Too many bad loans from the\nhousing crisis have made their way onto the books of too many banks.  With so\nmuch debt and so little confidence, these banks are now fearful of lending out\nany more money to households, to businesses, or to each other.  When there is\nno lending, families can\'t afford to buy homes or cars.  So businesses are\nforced to make layoffs.  Our economy suffers even more, and credit dries up\neven further.</p>\n\n<p>That is why this administration is moving swiftly and aggressively to break\nthis destructive cycle, restore confidence, and re-start lending.</p>\n\n<p>We will do so in several ways.  First, we are creating a new lending fund that\nrepresents the largest effort ever to help provide auto loans, college loans,\nand small business loans to the consumers and entrepreneurs who keep this\neconomy running.</p>\n\n<p>Second, we have launched a housing plan that will help responsible families\nfacing the threat of foreclosure lower their monthly payments and re-finance\ntheir mortgages.  It\'s a plan that won\'t help speculators or that neighbor\ndown the street who bought a house he could never hope to afford, but it will\nhelp millions of Americans who are struggling with declining home values --\nAmericans who will now be able to take advantage of the lower interest rates\nthat this plan has already helped bring about.  In fact, the average family\nwho re-finances today can save nearly $2000 per year on their mortgage.</p>\n\n<p>Third, we will act with the full force of the federal government to ensure\nthat the major banks that Americans depend on have enough confidence and\nenough money to lend even in more difficult times.  And when we learn that a\nmajor bank has serious problems, we will hold accountable those responsible,\nforce the necessary adjustments, provide the support to clean up their balance\nsheets, and assure the continuity of a strong, viable institution that can\nserve our people and our economy.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that on any given day, Wall Street may be more comforted by an\napproach that gives banks bailouts with no strings attached, and that holds\nnobody accountable for their reckless decisions.  But such an approach won\'t\nsolve the problem.  And our goal is to quicken the day when we re-start\nlending to the American people and American business and end this crisis once\nand for all.</p>\n\n<p>I intend to hold these banks fully accountable for the assistance they\nreceive, and this time, they will have to clearly demonstrate how taxpayer\ndollars result in more lending for the American taxpayer.  This time, CEOs\nwon\'t be able to use taxpayer money to pad their paychecks or buy fancy drapes\nor disappear on a private jet.  Those days are over.</p>\n\n<p>Still, this plan will require significant resources from the federal\ngovernment -- and yes, probably more than we\'ve already set aside.  But while\nthe cost of action will be great, I can assure you that the cost of inaction\nwill be far greater, for it could result in an economy that sputters along for\nnot months or years, but perhaps a decade.  That would be worse for our\ndeficit, worse for business, worse for you, and worse for the next generation.\n And I refuse to let that happen.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that when the last administration asked this Congress to provide\nassistance for struggling banks, Democrats and Republicans alike were\ninfuriated by the mismanagement and results that followed.  So were the\nAmerican taxpayers.  So was I.</p>\n\n<p>So I know how unpopular it is to be seen as helping banks right now,\nespecially when everyone is suffering in part from their bad decisions.  I\npromise you -- I get it.</p>\n\n<p>But I also know that in a time of crisis, we cannot afford to govern out of\nanger, or yield to the politics of the moment.  My job -- our job -- is to\nsolve the problem.  Our job is to govern with a sense of responsibility.  I\nwill not spend a single penny for the purpose of rewarding a single Wall\nStreet executive, but I will do whatever it takes to help the small business\nthat can\'t pay its workers or the family that has saved and still can\'t get a\nmortgage.</p>\n\n<p>That\'s what this is about.  It\'s not about helping banks -- it\'s about helping\npeople.  Because when credit is available again, that young family can finally\nbuy a new home.  And then some company will hire workers to build it.  And\nthen those workers will have money to spend, and if they can get a loan too,\nmaybe they\'ll finally buy that car, or open their own business.  Investors\nwill return to the market, and American families will see their retirement\nsecured once more.  Slowly, but surely, confidence will return, and our\neconomy will recover.</p>\n\n<p>So I ask this Congress to join me in doing whatever proves necessary.  Because\nwe cannot consign our nation to an open-ended recession.  And to ensure that a\ncrisis of this magnitude never happens again, I ask Congress to move quickly\non legislation that will finally reform our outdated regulatory system.  It is\ntime to put in place tough, new common-sense rules of the road so that our\nfinancial market rewards drive and innovation, and punishes short-cuts and\nabuse.</p>\n\n<p>The recovery plan and the financial stability plan are the immediate steps\nwe\'re taking to revive our economy in the short-term.  But the only way to\nfully restore America\'s economic strength is to make the long-term investments\nthat will lead to new jobs, new industries, and a renewed ability to compete\nwith the rest of the world. The only way this century will be another American\ncentury is if we confront at last the price of our dependence on oil and the\nhigh cost of health care; the schools that aren\'t preparing our children and\nthe mountain of debt they stand to inherit.  That is our responsibility.</p>\n\n<p>In the next few days, I will submit a budget to Congress.  So often, we have\ncome to view these documents as simply numbers on a page or laundry lists of\nprograms.  I see this document differently.  I see it as a vision for America\n-- as a blueprint for our future.</p>\n\n<p>My budget does not attempt to solve every problem or address every issue.  It\nreflects the stark reality of what we\'ve inherited -- a trillion dollar\ndeficit, a financial crisis, and a costly recession.</p>\n\n<p>Given these realities, everyone in this chamber -- Democrats and Republicans\n-- will have to sacrifice some worthy priorities for which there are no\ndollars.  And that includes me.</p>\n\n<p>But that does not mean we can afford to ignore our long-term challenges.  I\nreject the view that says our problems will simply take care of themselves;\nthat says government has no role in laying the foundation for our common\nprosperity.</p>\n\n<p>For history tells a different story.  History reminds us that at every moment\nof economic upheaval and transformation, this nation has responded with bold\naction and big ideas.  In the midst of civil war, we laid railroad tracks from\none coast to another that spurred commerce and industry.  From the turmoil of\nthe Industrial Revolution came a system of public high schools that prepared\nour citizens for a new age.  In the wake of war and depression, the GI Bill\nsent a generation to college and created the largest middle-class in history. \nAnd a twilight struggle for freedom led to a nation of highways, an American\non the moon, and an explosion of technology that still shapes our world.</p>\n\n<p>In each case, government didn\'t supplant private enterprise; it catalyzed\nprivate enterprise.  It created the conditions for thousands of entrepreneurs\nand new businesses to adapt and to thrive.</p>\n\n<p>We are a nation that has seen promise amid peril, and claimed opportunity from\nordeal.  Now we must be that nation again.  That is why, even as it cuts back\non the programs we don\'t need, the budget I submit will invest in the three\nareas that are absolutely critical to our economic future:  energy, health\ncare, and education.</p>\n\n<p>It begins with energy.</p>\n\n<p>We know the country that harnesses the power of clean, renewable energy will\nlead the 21st century.  And yet, it is China that has launched the largest\neffort in history to make their economy energy efficient.  We invented solar\ntechnology, but we\'ve fallen behind countries like Germany and Japan in\nproducing it.  New plug-in hybrids roll off our assembly lines, but they will\nrun on batteries made in Korea.</p>\n\n<p>Well I do not accept a future where the jobs and industries of tomorrow take\nroot beyond our borders -- and I know you don\'t either.  It is time for\nAmerica to lead again.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to our recovery plan, we will double this nation\'s supply of renewable\nenergy in the next three years.  We have also made the largest investment in\nbasic research funding in American history -- an investment that will spur not\nonly new discoveries in energy, but breakthroughs in medicine, science, and\ntechnology.</p>\n\n<p>We will soon lay down thousands of miles of power lines that can carry new\nenergy to cities and towns across this country.  And we will put Americans to\nwork making our homes and buildings more efficient so that we can save\nbillions of dollars on our energy bills.</p>\n\n<p>But to truly transform our economy, protect our security, and save our planet\nfrom the ravages of climate change, we need to ultimately make clean,\nrenewable energy the profitable kind of energy.  So I ask this Congress to\nsend me legislation that places a market-based cap on carbon pollution and\ndrives the production of more renewable energy in America.  And to support\nthat innovation, we will invest fifteen billion dollars a year to develop\ntechnologies like wind power and solar power; advanced biofuels, clean coal,\nand more fuel-efficient cars and trucks built right here in America.</p>\n\n<p>As for our auto industry, everyone recognizes that years of bad\ndecision-making and a global recession have pushed our automakers to the\nbrink.  We should not, and will not, protect them from their own bad\npractices.  But we are committed to the goal of a re-tooled, re-imagined auto\nindustry that can compete and win.  Millions of jobs depend on it.  Scores of\ncommunities depend on it.  And I believe the nation that invented the\nautomobile cannot walk away from it.</p>\n\n<p>None of this will come without cost, nor will it be easy.  But this is\nAmerica.  We don\'t do what\'s easy.  We do what is necessary to move this\ncountry forward.</p>\n\n<p>For that same reason, we must also address the crushing cost of health care.</p>\n\n<p>This is a cost that now causes a bankruptcy in America every thirty seconds. \nBy the end of the year, it could cause 1.5 million Americans to lose their\nhomes.  In the last eight years, premiums have grown four times faster than\nwages.  And in each of these years, one million more Americans have lost their\nhealth insurance.  It is one of the major reasons why small businesses close\ntheir doors and corporations ship jobs overseas.  And it\'s one of the largest\nand fastest-growing parts of our budget.</p>\n\n<p>Given these facts, we can no longer afford to put health care reform on hold.</p>\n\n<p>Already, we have done more to advance the cause of health care reform in the\nlast thirty days than we have in the last decade.  When it was days old, this\nCongress passed a law to provide and protect health insurance for eleven\nmillion American children whose parents work full-time.  Our recovery plan\nwill invest in electronic health records and new technology that will reduce\nerrors, bring down costs, ensure privacy, and save lives.  It will launch a\nnew effort to conquer a disease that has touched the life of nearly every\nAmerican by seeking a cure for cancer in our time.  And it makes the largest\ninvestment ever in preventive care, because that is one of the best ways to\nkeep our people healthy and our costs under control.</p>\n\n<p>This budget builds on these reforms.  It includes an historic commitment to\ncomprehensive health care reform -- a down-payment on the principle that we\nmust have quality, affordable health care for every American.  It\'s a\ncommitment that\'s paid for in part by efficiencies in our system that are long\noverdue.  And it\'s a step we must take if we hope to bring down our deficit in\nthe years to come.</p>\n\n<p>Now, there will be many different opinions and ideas about how to achieve\nreform, and that is why I\'m bringing together businesses and workers, doctors\nand health care providers, Democrats and Republicans to begin work on this\nissue next week.</p>\n\n<p>I suffer no illusions that this will be an easy process.  It will be hard. \nBut I also know that nearly a century after Teddy Roosevelt first called for\nreform, the cost of our health care has weighed down our economy and the\nconscience of our nation long enough.  So let there be no doubt: health care\nreform cannot wait, it must not wait, and it will not wait another year.</p>\n\n<p>The third challenge we must address is the urgent need to expand the promise\nof education in America.</p>\n\n<p>In a global economy where the most valuable skill you can sell is your\nknowledge, a good education is no longer just a pathway to opportunity -- it\nis a pre-requisite.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, three-quarters of the fastest-growing occupations require more than\na high school diploma.  And yet, just over half of our citizens have that\nlevel of education.  We have one of the highest high school dropout rates of\nany industrialized nation.  And half of the students who begin college never\nfinish.</p>\n\n<p>This is a prescription for economic decline, because we know the countries\nthat out-teach us today will out-compete us tomorrow.  That is why it will be\nthe goal of this administration to ensure that every child has access to a\ncomplete and competitive education -- from the day they are born to the day\nthey begin a career.</p>\n\n<p>Already, we have made an historic investment in education through the economic\nrecovery plan.  We have dramatically expanded early childhood education and\nwill continue to improve its quality, because we know that the most formative\nlearning comes in those first years of life.  We have made college affordable\nfor nearly seven million more students.  And we have provided the resources\nnecessary to prevent painful cuts and teacher layoffs that would set back our\nchildren\'s progress.</p>\n\n<p>But we know that our schools don\'t just need more resources.  They need more\nreform.  That is why this budget creates new incentives for teacher\nperformance; pathways for advancement, and rewards for success.  We\'ll invest\nin innovative programs that are already helping schools meet high standards\nand close achievement gaps.  And we will expand our commitment to charter\nschools.</p>\n\n<p>It is our responsibility as lawmakers and educators to make this system work. \nBut it is the responsibility of every citizen to participate in it.  And so\ntonight, I ask every American to commit to at least one year or more of higher\neducation or career training.  This can be community college or a four-year\nschool; vocational training or an apprenticeship.  But whatever the training\nmay be, every American will need to get more than a high school diploma.  And\ndropping out of high school is no longer an option.  It\'s not just quitting on\nyourself, it\'s quitting on your country -- and this country needs and values\nthe talents of every American.  That is why we will provide the support\nnecessary for you to complete college and meet a new goal:  by 2020, America\nwill once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.</p>\n\n<p>I know that the price of tuition is higher than ever, which is why if you are\nwilling to volunteer in your neighborhood or give back to your community or\nserve your country, we will make sure that you can afford a higher education. \nAnd to encourage a renewed spirit of national service for this and future\ngenerations, I ask this Congress to send me the bipartisan legislation that\nbears the name of Senator Orrin Hatch as well as an American who has never\nstopped asking what he can do for his country -- Senator Edward Kennedy.</p>\n\n<p>These education policies will open the doors of opportunity for our children. \nBut it is up to us to ensure they walk through them.  In the end, there is no\nprogram or policy that can substitute for a mother or father who will attend\nthose parent/teacher conferences, or help with homework after dinner, or turn\noff the TV, put away the video games, and read to their child.  I speak to you\nnot just as a President, but as a father when I say that responsibility for\nour children\'s education must begin at home.</p>\n\n<p>There is, of course, another responsibility we have to our children.  And that\nis the responsibility to ensure that we do not pass on to them a debt they\ncannot pay.  With the deficit we inherited, the cost of the crisis we face,\nand the long-term challenges we must meet, it has never been more important to\nensure that as our economy recovers, we do what it takes to bring this deficit\ndown.</p>\n\n<p>I\'m proud that we passed the recovery plan free of earmarks, and I want to\npass a budget next year that ensures that each dollar we spend reflects only\nour most important national priorities.</p>\n\n<p>Yesterday, I held a fiscal summit where I pledged to cut the deficit in half\nby the end of my first term in office.  My administration has also begun to go\nline by line through the federal budget in order to eliminate wasteful and\nineffective programs.  As you can imagine, this is a process that will take\nsome time.  But we\'re starting with the biggest lines.  We have already\nidentified two trillion dollars in savings over the next decade.</p>\n\n<p>In this budget, we will end education programs that don\'t work and end direct\npayments to large agribusinesses that don\'t need them.  We\'ll eliminate the\nno-bid contracts that have wasted billions in Iraq, and reform our defense\nbudget so that we\'re not paying for Cold War-era weapons systems we don\'t use.\n We will root out the waste, fraud, and abuse in our Medicare program that\ndoesn\'t make our seniors any healthier, and we will restore a sense of\nfairness and balance to our tax code by finally ending the tax breaks for\ncorporations that ship our jobs overseas.</p>\n\n<p>In order to save our children from a future of debt, we will also end the tax\nbreaks for the wealthiest 2% of Americans.  But let me perfectly clear,\nbecause I know you\'ll hear the same old claims that rolling back these tax\nbreaks means a massive tax increase on the American people:  if your family\nearns less than $250,000 a year, you will not see your taxes increased a\nsingle dime.  I repeat: not one single dime.  In fact, the recovery plan\nprovides a tax cut -- that\'s right, a tax cut -- for 95% of working families. \nAnd these checks are on the way.</p>\n\n<p>To preserve our long-term fiscal health, we must also address the growing\ncosts in Medicare and Social Security.  Comprehensive health care reform is\nthe best way to strengthen Medicare for years to come.  And we must also begin\na conversation on how to do the same for Social Security, while creating\ntax-free universal savings accounts for all Americans.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, because we\'re also suffering from a deficit of trust, I am committed\nto restoring a sense of honesty and accountability to our budget.  That is why\nthis budget looks ahead ten years and accounts for spending that was left out\nunder the old rules -- and for the first time, that includes the full cost of\nfighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.  For seven years, we have been a nation at\nwar.  No longer will we hide its price.</p>\n\n<p>We are now carefully reviewing our policies in both wars, and I will soon\nannounce a way forward in Iraq that leaves Iraq to its people and responsibly\nends this war.</p>\n\n<p>And with our friends and allies, we will forge a new and comprehensive\nstrategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan to defeat al Qaeda and combat extremism.\n Because I will not allow terrorists to plot against the American people from\nsafe havens half a world away.</p>\n\n<p>As we meet here tonight, our men and women in uniform stand watch abroad and\nmore are readying to deploy. To each and every one of them, and to the\nfamilies who bear the quiet burden of their absence, Americans are united in\nsending one message: we honor your service, we are inspired by your sacrifice,\nand you have our unyielding support.  To relieve the strain on our forces, my\nbudget increases the number of our soldiers and Marines. And to keep our\nsacred trust with those who serve, we will raise their pay, and give our\nveterans the expanded health care and benefits that they have earned.</p>\n\n<p>To overcome extremism, we must also be vigilant in upholding the values our\ntroops defend -- because there is no force in the world more powerful than the\nexample of America. That is why I have ordered the closing of the detention\ncenter at Guantanamo Bay, and will seek swift and certain justice for captured\nterrorists -- because living our values doesn\'t make us weaker, it makes us\nsafer and it makes us stronger.  And that is why I can stand here tonight and\nsay without exception or equivocation that the United States of America does\nnot torture.</p>\n\n<p>In words and deeds, we are showing the world that a new era of engagement has\nbegun.  For we know that America cannot meet the threats of this century\nalone, but the world cannot meet them without America.  We cannot shun the\nnegotiating table, nor ignore the foes or forces that could do us harm.  We\nare instead called to move forward with the sense of confidence and candor\nthat serious times demand.</p>\n\n<p>To seek progress toward a secure and lasting peace between Israel and her\nneighbors, we have appointed an envoy to sustain our effort.  To meet the\nchallenges of the 21st century -- from terrorism to nuclear proliferation;\nfrom pandemic disease to cyber threats to crushing poverty -- we will\nstrengthen old alliances, forge new ones, and use all elements of our national\npower.</p>\n\n<p>And to respond to an economic crisis that is global in scope, we are working\nwith the nations of the G-20 to restore confidence in our financial system,\navoid the possibility of escalating protectionism, and spur demand for\nAmerican goods in markets across the globe.  For the world depends on us to\nhave a strong economy, just as our economy depends on the strength of the\nworld\'s.</p>\n\n<p>As we stand at this crossroads of history, the eyes of all people in all\nnations are once again upon us -- watching to see what we do with this moment;\nwaiting for us to lead.</p>\n\n<p>Those of us gathered here tonight have been called to govern in extraordinary\ntimes.  It is a tremendous burden, but also a great privilege -- one that has\nbeen entrusted to few generations of Americans.  For in our hands lies the\nability to shape our world for good or for ill.</p>\n\n<p>I know that it is easy to lose sight of this truth -- to become cynical and\ndoubtful; consumed with the petty and the trivial.</p>\n\n<p>But in my life, I have also learned that hope is found in unlikely places;\nthat inspiration often comes not from those with the most power or celebrity,\nbut from the dreams and aspirations of Americans who are anything but\nordinary.</p>\n\n<p>I think about Leonard Abess, the bank president from Miami who reportedly\ncashed out of his company, took a $60 million bonus, and gave it out to all\n399 people who worked for him, plus another 72 who used to work for him.  He\ndidn\'t tell anyone, but when the local newspaper found out, he simply said,\n"I knew some of these people since I was 7 years old.  I didn\'t feel right\ngetting the money myself."</p>\n\n<p>I think about Greensburg, Kansas, a town that was completely destroyed by a\ntornado, but is being rebuilt by its residents as a global example of how\nclean energy can power an entire community -- how it can bring jobs and\nbusinesses to a place where piles of bricks and rubble once lay.  "The tragedy\nwas terrible," said one of the men who helped them rebuild.  "But the folks\nhere know that it also provided an incredible opportunity."</p>\n\n<p>And I think about Ty\'Sheoma Bethea, the young girl from that school I visited\nin Dillon, South Carolina -- a place where the ceilings leak, the paint peels\noff the walls, and they have to stop teaching six times a day because the\ntrain barrels by their classroom.  She has been told that her school is\nhopeless, but the other day after class she went to the public library and\ntyped up a letter to the people sitting in this room.  She even asked her\nprincipal for the money to buy a stamp.  The letter asks us for help, and\nsays, "We are just students trying to become lawyers, doctors, congressmen\nlike yourself and one day president, so we can make a change to not just the\nstate of South Carolina but also the world.  We are not quitters."</p>\n\n<p>We are not quitters.</p>\n\n<p>These words and these stories tell us something about the spirit of the people\nwho sent us here.  They tell us that even in the most trying times, amid the\nmost difficult circumstances, there is a generosity, a resilience, a decency,\nand a determination that perseveres; a willingness to take responsibility for\nour future and for posterity.</p>\n\n<p>Their resolve must be our inspiration.  Their concerns must be our cause.  And\nwe must show them and all our people that we are equal to the task before us.</p>\n\n<p>I know that we haven\'t agreed on every issue thus far, and there are surely\ntimes in the future when we will part ways.  But I also know that every\nAmerican who is sitting here tonight loves this country and wants it to\nsucceed.  That must be the starting point for every debate we have in the\ncoming months, and where we return after those debates are done.  That is the\nfoundation on which the American people expect us to build common ground.</p>\n\n<p>And if we do -- if we come together and lift this nation from the depths of\nthis crisis; if we put our people back to work and restart the engine of our\nprosperity; if we confront without fear the challenges of our time and summon\nthat enduring spirit of an America that does not quit, then someday years from\nnow our children can tell their children that this was the time when we\nperformed, in the words that are carved into this very chamber, "something\nworthy to be remembered."  Thank you, God Bless you, and may God Bless the\nUnited States of America.\n</p>\n\t\t\t<div class="textNav"><a href="#top">^ Return to top</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>\n\t<div id="footer"><strong><em>State of the Union</em></strong> is a project\n\t\tby Brad Borevitz at <a href="http://www.onetwothree.net">onetwothree.net</a></div>\n</div>\n<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">\n</script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n_uacct = "UA-410742-1";\nurchinTracker();\n</script>\n</body>\n<!-- InstanceEnd -->\n</html>\n'
