Eisenhower</h2>\n\t\t\t<h3>January 7, 1960</h3>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p>\nMr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the 86th Congress:</p>\n\n<p>Seven years ago I entered my present office with one long-held resolve\noverriding all others. I was then, and remain now, determined that the\nUnited States shall become an ever more potent resource for the cause of\npeace--realizing that peace cannot be for ourselves alone, but for peoples\neverywhere. This determination is shared by the entire Congress--indeed, by\nall Americans.</p>\n\n<p>My purpose today is to discuss some features of America\'s position, both at\nhome and in her relations to others.</p>\n\n<p>First, I point out that for us, annual self-examination is made a definite\nnecessity by the fact that we now live in a divided world of uneasy\nequilibrium, with our side committed to its own protection and against\naggression by the other.</p>\n\n<p>With both sides of this divided world in possession of unbelievably\ndestructive weapons, mankind approaches a state where mutual annihilation\nbecomes a possibility. No other fact of today\'s world equals this in\nimportance--it colors everything we say, plan, and do.</p>\n\n<p>There is demanded of us, vigilance, determination, and the dedication of\nwhatever portion of our resources that will provide adequate security,\nespecially a real deterrent to aggression. These things we are doing.</p>\n\n<p>All these facts emphasize the importance of striving incessantly for a just\npeace.</p>\n\n<p>Only through the strengthening of the spiritual, intellectual, economic and\ndefensive resources of the Free World can we, in confidence, make progress\ntoward this goal.</p>\n\n<p>Second, we note that recent Soviet deportment and pronouncements suggest\nthe possible opening of a somewhat less strained period in the\nrelationships between the Soviet Union and the Free World. If these\nPronouncements be genuine, there is brighter hope of diminishing the\nintensity of past rivalry and eventually of substituting persuasion for\ncoercion. Whether this is to become an era of lasting promise remains to be\ntested by actions.</p>\n\n<p>Third, we now stand in the vestibule of a vast new technological age-one\nthat, despite its capacity for human destruction, has an equal capacity to\nmake poverty and human misery obsolete. If our efforts are wisely\ndirected--and if our unremitting efforts for dependable peace begin to\nattain some success--we can surely become participants in creating an age\ncharacterized by justice and rising levels of human well-being.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past year the Soviet Union has expressed an interest in measures\nto reduce the common peril of war.</p>\n\n<p>While neither we nor any other Free World nation can permit ourselves to be\nmisled by pleasant promises until they are tested by performance, yet we\napproach this apparently new opportunity with the utmost seriousness. We\nmust strive to break the calamitous cycle of frustrations and crises which,\nif unchecked, could spiral into nuclear disaster; the ultimate insanity.</p>\n\n<p>Though the need for dependable agreements to assure against resort to force\nin settling disputes is apparent to both sides yet as in other issues\ndividing men and nations, we cannot expect sudden and revolutionary\nresults. But we must find some place to begin.</p>\n\n<p>One obvious road on which to make a useful start is in the widening of\ncommunication between our two peoples. In this field there are, both sides\nwilling, countless opportunities--most of them well known to us all--for\ndeveloping mutual understanding, the true foundation of peace.</p>\n\n<p>Another avenue may be through the reopening, on January twelfth, of\nnegotiations looking to a controlled ban on the testing of nuclear weapons.\nUnfortunately, the closing statement from the Soviet scientists who met\nwith our scientists at Geneva in an unsuccessful effort to develop an\nagreed basis for a test ban, gives the clear impression that their\nconclusions have been politically guided. Those of the British and American\nscientific representatives are their own freely-formed, individual and\ncollective opinion. I am hopeful that as new negotiations begin, truth--not\npolitical opportunism--will be the guiding light of the deliberations.</p>\n\n<p>Still another avenue may be found in the field of disarmament, in which the\nSoviets have professed a readiness to negotiate seriously. They have not,\nhowever, made clear the plans they may have, if any, for mutual inspection\nand verification--the essential condition for any extensive measure of\ndisarmament.</p>\n\n<p>There is one instance where our initiative for peace has recently been\nsuccessful. A multi-lateral treaty signed last month provides for the\nexclusively peaceful use of Antarctica, assured by a system of inspection.\nIt provides for free and cooperative scientific research in that continent,\nand prohibits nuclear explosions there pending general international\nagreement on the subject. The Treaty is a significant contribution toward\npeace, international cooperation, and the advancement of science. I shall\ntransmit its text to the Senate for consideration and approval in the near\nfuture.</p>\n\n<p>The United States is always ready to participate with the Soviet Union in\nserious discussion of these or any other subjects that may lead to peace\nwith justice.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly it is not necessary to repeat that the United States has no\nintention of interfering in the internal affairs of any nation; likewise we\nreject any attempt to impose its system on us or on other peoples by force\nor subversion.</p>\n\n<p>This concern for the freedom of other peoples is the intellectual and\nspiritual cement which has allied us with more than forty other nations in\na common defense effort. Not for a moment do we forget that our own fate is\nfirmly fastened to that of these countries; we will not act in any way\nwhich would jeopardize our solemn commitments to them.</p>\n\n<p>We and our friends are, of course, concerned with self-defense. Growing out\nof this concern is the realization that all people of the Free World have a\ngreat stake in the progress, in freedom, of the uncommitted and newly\nemerging nations. These peoples, desperately hoping to lift themselves to\ndecent levels of living must not, by our neglect, be forced to seek help\nfrom, and finally become virtual satellites of, those who proclaim their\nhostility to freedom.</p>\n\n<p>Their natural desire for a better life must not be frustrated by\nwithholding from them necessary technical and investment assistance. This\nis a problem to be solved not by America alone, but also by every nation\ncherishing the same ideals and in position to provide help.</p>\n\n<p>In recent years America\'s partners and friends in Western Europe and Japan\nhave made great economic progress. Their newly found economic strength is\neloquent testimony to the striking success of the policies of economic\ncooperation which we and they have pursued.</p>\n\n<p>The international economy of 1960 is markedly different from that of the\nearly postwar years. No longer is the United States the only major\nindustrial country capable of providing substantial amounts of the\nresources so urgently needed in the newly-developing countries.</p>\n\n<p>To remain secure and prosperous themselves, wealthy nations must extend the\nkind of cooperation to the less fortunate members that will inspire hope,\nconfidence and progress. A rich nation can for a time, without noticeable\ndamage to itself, pursue a course of self-indulgence, making its single\ngoal the material ease and comfort of its own citizens-thus repudiating its\nown spiritual and material stake in a peaceful and prosperous society of\nnations. But the enmities it will incur, the isolation into which it will\ndescend, and the internal moral and physical softness that will be\nengendered, will, in the long term, bring it to disaster.</p>\n\n<p>America did not become great through softness and self-indulgence. Her\nmiraculous progress and achievements flow from other qualities far more\nworthy and substantial--</p>\n\n<p>--adherence to principles and methods consonant with our religious\nphilosophy</p>\n\n<p>--a satisfaction in hard work</p>\n\n<p>--the readiness to sacrifice for worthwhile causes</p>\n\n<p>--the courage to meet every challenge to her progress</p>\n\n<p>--the intellectual honesty and capacity to recognize the true path of her\nown best interests.</p>\n\n<p>To us and to every nation of the Free World, rich or poor, these qualities\nare necessary today as never before if we are to march together to greater\nsecurity, prosperity and peace.</p>\n\n<p>I believe the industrial countries are ready to participate actively in\nsupplementing the efforts of the developing countries to achieve progress.</p>\n\n<p>The immediate need for this kind of cooperation is underscored by the\nstrain in our international balance of payments. Our surplus from foreign\nbusiness transactions has in recent years fallen substantially short of the\nexpenditures we make abroad to maintain our military establishments\noverseas, to finance private investment, and to provide assistance to the\nless developed nations. In 1959 our deficit in balance of payments\napproached $4 billion.</p>\n\n<p>Continuing deficits of anything like this magnitude would, over time,\nimpair our own economic growth and check the forward progress of the Free\nWorld.</p>\n\n<p>We must meet this situation by promoting a rising volume of exports and\nworld trade. Further, we must induce all industrialized nations of the Free\nWorld to work together in a new cooperative endeavor to help lift the\nscourge of poverty from less fortunate nations. This will provide for\nbetter sharing of this burden and for still further profitable trade.</p>\n\n<p>New nations, and others struggling with the problems of development, will\nprogress only if they demonstrate faith in their own destiny and possess\nthe will and use their own resources to fulfill it. Moreover, progress in a\nnational transformation can be only gradually earned; there is no easy and\nquick way to follow from the oxcart to the jet plane. But, just as we drew\non Europe for assistance in our earlier years, so now do those new and\nemerging nations that have this faith and determination deserve help.</p>\n\n<p>Over the last fifteen years, twenty nations have gained political\nindependence. Others are doing so each year. Most of them are woefully\nlacking in technical capacity and in investment capital; without Free World\nsupport in these matters they cannot effectively progress in freedom.</p>\n\n<p>Respecting their need, one of the major focal points of our concern is the\nSouth Asian region. Here, in two nations alone, are almost five hundred\nmillion people, all working, and working hard, to raise their standards,\nand in doing so, to make of themselves a strong bulwark against the spread\nof an ideology that would destroy liberty.</p>\n\n<p>I cannot express to you the depth of my conviction that, in our own and\nFree World interests, we must cooperate with others to help these people\nachieve their legitimate ambitions, as expressed in their different\nmulti-year plans. Through the World Bank and other instrumentalities, as\nwell as through individual action by every nation in position to help, we\nmust squarely face this titanic challenge.</p>\n\n<p>All of us must realize, of course, that development in freedom by the newly\nemerging nations, is no mere matter of obtaining outside financial\nassistance. An indispensable element in this process is a strong and\ncontinuing determination on the part of these nations to exercise the\nnational discipline necessary for any sustained development period. These\nqualities of determination are particularly essential because of the fact\nthat the process of improvement will necessarily be gradual and laborious\nrather than revolutionary. Moreover, everyone should be aware that the\ndevelopment process is no short term phenomenon. Many years are required\nfor even the most favorably situated countries.</p>\n\n<p>I shall continue to urge the American people, in the interests of their own\nsecurity, prosperity and peace, to make sure that their own part of this\ngreat project be amply and cheerfully supported. Free World decisions in\nthis matter may spell the difference between world disaster and world\nprogress in freedom.</p>\n\n<p>Other countries, some of which I visited last month, have similar needs.</p>\n\n<p>A common meeting ground is desirable for those nations which are prepared\nto assist in the development effort. During the past year I have discussed\nthis matter with the leaders of several Western Nations.</p>\n\n<p>Because of its wealth of experience, the Organization for European Economic\nCooperation could help with initial studies. The goal is to enlist all\navailable economic resources in the industrialized Free World-especially\nprivate investment capital. But I repeat that .this help, no matter how\ngreat, can be lastingly effective only if it is used as a supplement to the\nstrength of spirit and will of the people of the newly-developing nations.</p>\n\n<p>By extending this help we hope to make possible the enthusiastic enrollment\nof these nations under freedom\'s banner. No more startling contrast to a\nsystem of sullen satellites could be imagined.</p>\n\n<p>If we grasp this opportunity to build an age of productive partnership\nbetween the less fortunate nations and those that have already achieved a\nhigh state of economic advancement, we will make brighter the outlook for a\nworld order based upon security, freedom and peace. Otherwise, the outlook\ncould be dark indeed. We face what may be a turning point in history, and\nwe must act decisively.</p>\n\n<p>As a nation we can successfully pursue these objectives only from a\nposition of broadly based strength.</p>\n\n<p>No matter how earnest is our quest for guaranteed peace, we must maintain a\nhigh degree of military effectiveness at the same time we are engaged in\nnegotiating the issue of arms reduction. Until tangible and mutually\nenforceable arms reduction measures are worked out, we will not weaken the\nmeans of defending our institutions.</p>\n\n<p>America possesses an enormous defense power. It is my studied conviction\nthat no nation will ever risk general war against us unless we should be so\nfoolish as to neglect the defense forces we now so powerfully support. It\nis world-wide knowledge that any nation which might be tempted today to\nattack the United States, even though our country might sustain great\nlosses, would itself promptly suffer a terrible destruction. But I once\nagain assure all peoples and all nations that the United States, except in\ndefense, will never turn loose this destructive power.</p>\n\n<p>During the past year, our long-range striking power, unmatched today in\nmanned bombers, has taken on new strength as the Atlas intercontinental\nballistic missile has entered the operational inventory. In fourteen recent\ntest launchings, at ranges of over 5,000 miles, Atlas has been striking on\nan average within two miles of the target. This is less than the length of\na jet runway--well within the circle of total destruction. Such performance\nis a great tribute to American scientists and engineers, who in the past\nfive years have had to telescope time and technology to develop these\nlong-range ballistic missiles, where America had none before.</p>\n\n<p>This year, moreover, growing numbers of nuclear-powered submarines will\nenter our active forces, some to be armed with Polaris missiles. These\nremarkable ships and weapons, ranging the oceans, will be capable of\naccurate fire on targets virtually anywhere on earth. Impossible to destroy\nby surprise attack, they will become one of our most effective sentinels\nfor peace.</p>\n\n<p>To meet situations of less than general nuclear war, we continue to\nmaintain our carrier forces, our many service units abroad, our always\nready Army strategic forces and Marine Corps divisions, and the civilian\ncomponents. The continuing modernization of these forces is a costly but\nnecessary process, and is scheduled to go forward at a rate which will\nsteadily add to our strength.</p>\n\n<p>The deployment of a portion of these forces beyond our shores, on land and\nsea, is persuasive demonstration of our determination to stand\nshoulder-to-shoulder with our allies for collective security. Moreover, I\nhave directed that steps be taken to program our military assistance to\nthese allies on a longer range basis. This is necessary for a sounder\ncollective defense system.</p>\n\n<p>Next I refer to our effort in space exploration, which is often mistakenly\nsupposed to be an integral part of defense research and development.</p>\n\n<p>First, America has made great contributions in the past two years to the\nworld\'s fund of knowledge of astrophysics and space science. These\ndiscoveries are of present interest chiefly to the scientific community;\nbut they are important foundation-stones for more extensive exploration of\nouter space for the ultimate benefit of all mankind.</p>\n\n<p>Second, our military missile program, going forward so successfully, does\nnot suffer from our present lack of very large rocket engines, which are so\nnecessary in distant space exploration. I am assured by experts that the\nthrust of our present missiles is fully adequate for defense requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Third, the United States is pressing forward in the development of large\nrocket engines to place much heavier vehicles into space for exploration\npurposes.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth, in the meantime, it is necessary to remember that we have only\nbegun to probe the environment immediately surrounding the earth. Using\nlaunch systems presently available, we are developing satellites to scout\nthe world\'s weather; satellite relay stations to facilitate and extend\ncommunications over the globe; for navigation aids to give accurate\nbearings to ships and aircraft; and for perfecting instruments to collect\nand transmit the data we seek. This is the area holding the most promise\nfor early and useful applications of space technology.</p>\n\n<p>Fifth, we have just completed a year\'s experience with our new space law. I\nbelieve it deficient in certain particulars and suggested improvements will\nbe submitted shortly.</p>\n\n<p>The accomplishment of the many tasks I have alluded to requires the\ncontinuous strengthening of the spiritual, intellectual, and economic\nsinews of American life. The steady purpose of our society is to assure\njustice, before God, for every individual. We must be ever alert that\nfreedom does not wither through the careless amassing of restrictive\ncontrols or the lack of courage to deal boldly with the giant issues of the\nday.</p>\n\n<p>A year ago, when I met with you, the nation was emerging from an economic\ndownturn, even though the signs of resurgent prosperity were not then\nsufficiently convincing to the doubtful. Today our surging strength is\napparent to everyone. 1960 promises to be the most prosperous year in our\nhistory.</p>\n\n<p>Yet we continue to be afflicted by nagging disorders.</p>\n\n<p>Among current problems that require solution are:</p>\n\n<p>--the need to protect the public interest in situations of prolonged\nlabor-management stalemate;</p>\n\n<p>--the persistent refusal to come to grips with a critical problem in one\nsector of American agriculture;</p>\n\n<p>--the continuing threat of inflation, together with the persisting tendency\ntoward fiscal irresponsibility;</p>\n\n<p>--in certain instances the denial to some of our citizens of equal\nprotection of the law.</p>\n\n<p>Every American was disturbed by the prolonged dispute in the steel industry\nand the protracted delay in reaching a settlement.</p>\n\n<p>We are all relieved that a settlement has at last been achieved in that\nindustry. Percentagewise, by this settlement the increase to the steel\ncompanies in employment costs is lower than in any prior wage settlement\nsince World War II. It is also gratifying to note that despite the increase\nin wages and benefits several of the major steel producers have announced\nthat there will be no increase in steel prices at this time. The national\ninterest demands that in the period of industrial peace which has been\nassured by the new contract both management and labor make every possible\neffort to increase efficiency and productivity in the manufacture of steel\nso that price increases can be avoided.</p>\n\n<p>One of the lessons of this story is that the potential danger to the entire\nNation of longer and greater strikes must be met. To insure against such\npossibilities we must of course depend primarily upon the good commonsense\nof the responsible individuals. It is my intention to encourage regular\ndiscussions between management and labor outside the bargaining table, to\nconsider the interest of the public as well as their mutual interest in the\nmaintenance of industrial peace, price stability and economic growth.</p>\n\n<p>To me, it seems almost absurd for the United States to recognize the need,\nand so earnestly to seek, for cooperation among the nations unless we can\nachieve voluntary, dependable, abiding cooperation among the important\nsegments of our own free society.</p>\n\n<p>Failure to face up to basic issues in areas other than those of\nlabor-management can cause serious strains on the firm freedom supports of\nour society.</p>\n\n<p>I refer to agriculture as one of these areas.</p>\n\n<p>Our basic farm laws were written 27 years ago, in an emergency effort to\nredress hardship caused by a world-wide depression. They were\ncontinued--and their economic distortions intensified--during World War II\nin order to provide incentives for production of food needed to sustain a\nwar-torn free world.</p>\n\n<p>Today our farm problem is totally different. It is that of effectively\nadjusting to the changes caused by a scientific revolution. When the\noriginal farm laws were written, an hour\'s farm labor produced only one\nfourth as much wheat as at present. Farm legislation is woefully\nout-of-date, ineffective, and expensive.</p>\n\n<p>For years we have gone on with an outmoded system which not only has failed\nto protect farm income, but also has produced soaring, threatening\nsurpluses. Our farms have been left producing for war while America has\nlong been at peace.</p>\n\n<p>Once again I urge Congress to enact legislation that will gear production\nmore closely to markets, make costly surpluses more manageable, provide\ngreater freedom in farm operations, and steadily achieve increased net farm\nincomes.</p>\n\n<p>Another issue that we must meet squarely is that of living within our\nmeans. This requires restraint in expenditure, constant reassessment of\npriorities, and the maintenance of stable prices.</p>\n\n<p>We must prevent inflation. Here is an opponent of so many guises that it is\nsometimes difficult to recognize. But our clear need is to stop continuous\nand general price rises--a need that all of us can see and feel.</p>\n\n<p>To prevent steadily rising costs and prices calls for stern self-discipline\nby every citizen. No person, city, state, or organized group can afford to\nevade the obligation to resist inflation, for every American pays its\ncrippling tax.</p>\n\n<p>Inflation\'s ravages do not end at the water\'s edge. Increases in prices of\nthe goods we sell abroad threaten to drive us out of markets that once were\nsecurely ours. Whether domestic prices, so high as to be noncompetitive,\nresult from demands for too-high profit margins or from increased labor\ncosts that outrun growth in productivity, the final result is seriously\ndamaging to the nation.</p>\n\n<p>We must fight inflation as we would a fire that imperils our home. Only by\nso doing can we prevent it from destroying our salaries, savings, pensions\nand insurance, and from gnawing away the very roots of a free, healthy\neconomy and the nation\'s security.</p>\n\n<p>One major method by which the Federal government can counter inflation and\nrising prices is to insure that its expenditures are below its revenues.\nThe debt with which we are now confronted is about 290 billion dollars.\nWith interest charges alone now costing taxpayers about 9 1/2 billions, it\nis clear that this debt growth must stop. You will be glad to know that\ndespite the unsettling influences of the recent steel strike, we estimate\nthat our accounts will show, on June 30, this year, a favorable balance of\napproximately $200 million.</p>\n\n<p>I shall present to the Congress for 1961 a balanced budget. In the area of\ndefense, expenditures continue at the record peace-time levels of the last\nseveral years. With a single exception, expenditures in every major\ncategory of Health, Education and Welfare will be equal or greater than\nlast year. In Space expenditures the amounts are practically doubled. But\nthe over-all guiding goal of this budget is national need-not response to\nspecific group, local or political insistence.</p>\n\n<p>Expenditure increases, other than those I have indicated, are largely\naccounted for by the increased cost of legislation previously enacted.[1]</p>\n\n<p>[Footnote 1: At this point the President interpolated the two paragraphs\nshown in brackets.]</p>\n\n<p>[I repeat, this budget will be a balanced one. Expenditures will be 79\nbillion 8 hundred million. The amount of income over outgo, described\nin the budget as a Surplus, to be applied against our national debt, is\n4 billion 2 hundred million. Personally, I do not feel that any amount can\nbe properly called a "Surplus" as long as the nation is in debt. I prefer\nto think of such an item as "reduction on our children\'s inherited\nmortgage." Once we have established such payments as normal practice, we\ncan profitably make improvements in our tax structure and thereby truly\nreduce the heavy burdens of taxation.</p>\n\n<p>[In any event, this one reduction will save taxpayers, each year,\napproximately 2 hundred million dollars in interest costs.]</p>\n\n<p>This budget will help ease pressures in our credit and capital markets. It\nwill enhance the confidence of people all over the world in the strength of\nour economy and our currency and in our individual and collective ability\nto be fiscally responsible.</p>\n\n<p>In the management of the huge public debt the Treasury is unfortunately not\nfree of artificial barriers. Its ability to deal with the difficult\nproblems in this field has been weakened greatly by the unwillingness of\nthe Congress to remove archaic restrictions. The need for a freer hand in\ndebt management is even more urgent today because the costs of the\nundesirable financing practices which the Treasury has been forced into are\nmounting. Removal of this roadblock has high priority in my legislative\nrecommendations.</p>\n\n<p>Still another issue relates to civil rights.</p>\n\n<p>In all our hopes and plans for a better world we all recognize that\nprovincial and racial prejudices must be combatted. In the long perspective\nof history, the right to vote has been one of the strongest pillars of a\nfree society. Our first duty is to protect this right against all\nencroachment. In spite of constitutional guarantees, and notwithstanding\nmuch progress of recent years, bias still deprives some persons in this\ncountry of equal protection of the laws.</p>\n\n<p>Early in your last session I recommended legislation which would help\neliminate several practices discriminating against the basic rights of\nAmericans. The Civil Rights Commission has developed additional\nconstructive recommendations. I hope that these will be among the matters\nto be seriously considered in the current session. I trust that Congress\nwill thus signal to the world that our Government is striving for equality\nunder law for all our people.</p>\n\n<p>Each year and in many ways our nation continues to undergo profound change\nand growth.</p>\n\n<p>In the past 18 months we have hailed the entry of two more States of the\nUnion--Alaska and Hawaii. We salute these two western stars proudly.</p>\n\n<p>Our vigorous expansion, which we all welcome as a sign of health and\nvitality, is many-sided. We are, for example, witnessing explosive growth\nin metropolitan areas.</p>\n\n<p>By 1975 the metropolitan areas of the United States will occupy twice the\nterritory they do today. The roster of urban problems with which they must\ncope is staggering. They involve water supply, cleaning the air, adjusting\nlocal tax systems, providing for essential educational, cultural, and\nsocial services, and destroying those conditions which breed delinquency\nand crime.</p>\n\n<p>In meeting these, we must, if we value our historic freedoms, keep within\nthe traditional framework of our Federal system with powers divided between\nthe national and state governments. The uniqueness of this system may\nconfound the casual observer, but it has worked effectively for nearly 200\nyears.</p>\n\n<p>I do not doubt that our urban and other perplexing problems can be solved\nin the traditional American method. In doing so we must realize that\nnothing is really solved and ruinous tendencies are set in motion by\nyielding to the deceptive bait of the "easy" Federal tax dollar.</p>\n\n<p>Our educational system provides a ready example. All recognize the vital\nnecessity of having modern school plants, well-qualified and adequately\ncompensated teachers, and of using the best possible teaching techniques\nand curricula.</p>\n\n<p>We cannot be complacent about educating our youth.</p>\n\n<p>But the route to better trained minds is not through the swift\nadministration of a Federal hypodermic or sustained financial transfusion.\nThe educational process, essentially a local and personal responsibility,\ncannot be made to leap ahead by crash, centralized governmental action.</p>\n\n<p>The Administration has proposed a carefully reasoned program for helping\neliminate current deficiencies. It is designed to stimulate classroom\nconstruction, not by substitution of Federal dollars for state and local\nfunds, but by incentives to extend and encourage state and local efforts.\nThis approach rejects the notion of Federal domination or control. It is\nworkable, and should appeal to every American interested in advancement of\nour educational system in the traditional American way. I urge the Congress\nto take action upon it.</p>\n\n<p>There is one other subject concerning which I renew a recommendation I made\nin my State of the Union Message last January. I then advised the Congress\nof my purpose to intensify our efforts to replace force with a rule of law\namong nations. From many discussions abroad, I am convinced that purpose is\nwidely and deeply shared by other peoples and nations of the world.</p>\n\n<p>In the same Message I stated that our efforts would include a reexamination\nof our own relation to the International Court of Justice. The Court was\nestablished by the United Nations to decide international legal disputes\nbetween nations. In 1946 we accepted the Court\'s jurisdiction, but subject\nto a reservation of the right to determine unilaterally whether a matter\nlies essentially within domestic jurisdiction. There is pending before the\nSenate, a Resolution which would repeal our present self-judging\nreservation. I support that Resolution and urge its prompt passage. If this\nis done, I intend to urge similar acceptance of the Court\'s jurisdiction by\nevery member of the United Nations.</p>\n\n<p>Here perhaps it is not amiss for me to say to the Members of the Congress,\nin this my final year of office, a word about the institutions we\nrespectively represent and the meaning which the relationships between our\ntwo branches has for the days ahead.</p>\n\n<p>I am not unique as a President in having worked with a Congress controlled\nby the opposition party--except that no other President ever did it for\nquite so long! Yet in both personal and official relationships we have\nweathered the storms of the past five years. For this I am grateful.</p>\n\n<p>My deep concern in the next twelve months, before my successor takes\noffice, is with our joint Congressional-Executive duty to our own and to\nother nations. Acting upon the beliefs I have expressed here today, I shall\ndevote my full energies to the tasks at hand, whether these involve travel\nfor promoting greater world understanding, negotiations to reduce\ninternational discord, or constant discussions and communications with the\nCongress and the American people on issues both domestic and foreign.</p>\n\n<p>In pursuit of these objectives, I look forward to, and shall dedicate\nmyself to, a close and constructive association with the Congress.</p>\n\n<p>Every minute spent in irrelevant interbranch wrangling is precious time\ntaken from the intelligent initiation and adoption of coherent policies for\nour national survival and progress.</p>\n\n<p>We seek a common goal--brighter opportunity for our own citizens and a\nworld peace with justice for all.</p>\n\n<p>Before us and our friends is the challenge of an ideology which, for more\nthan four decades, has trumpeted abroad its purpose of gaining ultimate\nvictory over all forms of government at variance with its own.</p>\n\n<p>We realize that however much we repudiate the tenets of imperialistic\nCommunism, it represents a gigantic enterprise grimly pursued by leaders\nwho compel its subjects to subordinate their freedom of action and spirit\nand personal desires for some hoped-for advantage in the future.</p>\n\n<p>The Communists can present an array of material accomplishments over the\npast fifteen years that lends a false persuasiveness to many of their\nglittering promises to the uncommitted peoples.</p>\n\n<p>The competition they provide is formidable.</p>\n\n<p>But in our scale of values we place freedom first--our whole national\nexistence and development have been geared to that basic concept and are\nresponsible for the position of free world leadership to which we have\nsucceeded. It is the highest prize that any nation can possess; it is one\nthat Communism can never offer. And America\'s record of material\naccomplishment in freedom is written not only in the unparalleled\nprosperity of our own nation, but in the many billions we have devoted to\nthe reconstruction of Free World economics wrecked by World War II and in\nthe effective help of many more billions we have given in saving the\nindependence of many others threatened by outside domination. Assuredly we\nhave the capacity for handling the problems in the new era of the world\'s\nhistory we are now entering.</p>\n\n<p>But we must use that capacity intelligently and tirelessly, regardless of\npersonal sacrifice.</p>\n\n<p>The fissure that divides our political planet is deep and wide.</p>\n\n<p>We live, moreover, in a sea of semantic disorder in which old labels no\nlonger faithfully describe.</p>\n\n<p>Police states are called "people\'s democracies."</p>\n\n<p>Armed conquest of free people is called "liberation."</p>\n\n<p>Such slippery slogans make more difficult the problem of communicating true\nfaith, facts and beliefs.</p>\n\n<p>We must make clear our peaceful intentions, our aspirations for a better\nworld. So doing, we must use language to enlighten the mind, not as the\ninstrument of the studied innuendo and distorter of truth.</p>\n\n<p>And we must live by what we say.</p>\n\n<p>On my recent visit to distant lands I found one statesman after another\neager to tell me of the elements of their government that had been borrowed\nfrom our American Constitution, and from the indestructible ideals set\nforth in our Declaration of Independence.</p>\n\n<p>As a nation we take pride that our own constitutional system, and the\nideals which sustain it, have been long viewed as a fountainhead of\nfreedom.</p>\n\n<p>By our every action we must strive to make ourselves worthy of this trust,\never mindful that an accumulation of seemingly minor encroachments upon\nfreedom gradually could break down the entire fabric of a free society.</p>\n\n<p>So persuaded, we shall get on with the task before us.</p>\n\n<p>So dedicated, and with faith in the Almighty, humanity shall one day\nachieve the unity in freedom to which all men have aspired from the dawn of\ntime.\n</p>\n\t\t\t<div class="textNav"><a href="#top">^ Return to top</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>\n\t<div id="footer"><strong><em>State of the Union</em></strong> is a project\n\t\tby Brad Borevitz at <a href="http://www.onetwothree.net">onetwothree.net</a></div>\n</div>\n<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">\n</script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n_uacct = "UA-410742-1";\nurchinTracker();\n</script>\n</body>\n<!-- InstanceEnd -->\n</html>\n'
