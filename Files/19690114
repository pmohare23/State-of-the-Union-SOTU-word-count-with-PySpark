Johnson</h2>\n\t\t\t<h3>January 14, 1969</h3>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p>\nMr. Speaker, Mr. President, Members of the Congress and my fellow\nAmericans:</p>\n\n<p>For the sixth and the last time, I present to the Congress my assessment of\nthe State of the Union.</p>\n\n<p>I shall speak to you tonight about challenge and opportunity--and about the\ncommitments that all of us have made together that will, if we carry them\nout, give America our best chance to achieve the kind of great society that\nwe all want. Every President lives, not only with what is, but with what\nhas been and what could be.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the great events in his Presidency are part of a larger sequence\nextending back through several years and extending back through several\nother administrations.</p>\n\n<p>Urban unrest, poverty, pressures on welfare, education of our people, law\nenforcement and law and order, the continuing crisis in the Middle East,\nthe conflict in Vietnam, the dangers of nuclear war, the great difficulties\nof dealing with the Communist powers, all have this much in common: They\nand their causes--the causes that gave rise to them--all of these have\nexisted with us for many years. Several Presidents have already sought to\ntry to deal with them. One or more Presidents will try to resolve them or\ntry to contain them in the years that are ahead of us.</p>\n\n<p>But if the Nation\'s problems are continuing, so are this great Nation\'s\nassets:</p>\n\n<p>--our economy,</p>\n\n<p>--the democratic system,</p>\n\n<p>--our sense of exploration, symbolized most recently by the wonderful\nflight of the Apollo 8, in which all Americans took great pride,</p>\n\n<p>--the good commonsense and sound judgment of the American people, and</p>\n\n<p>--their essential love of justice.</p>\n\n<p>We must not ignore our problems. But .neither should we ignore our\nstrengths. Those strengths are available to sustain a President of either\nparty--to support his progressive efforts both at home and overseas.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the departure of an administration does not mean the end of\nthe problems that this administration has faced. The effort to meet the\nproblems must go on, year after year, if the momentum that we have all\nmounted together in these past years is not to be lost.</p>\n\n<p>Although the struggle for progressive change is continuous, there are times\nwhen a watershed is reached--when there is--if not really a break with the\npast--at least the fulfillment of many of its oldest hopes, and a stepping\nforth into a new environment, to seek new goals. I think the past 5 years\nhave been such a time.</p>\n\n<p>We have finished a major part of the old agenda.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the laws that we wrote have already, in front of our eyes, taken on\nthe flesh of achievement.</p>\n\n<p>Medicare that we were unable to pass for so many years is now a part of\nAmerican life.</p>\n\n<p>Voting rights and the voting booth that we debated so long back in the\nriffles, and the doors to public service, are open at last to all Americans\nregardless of their color.</p>\n\n<p>Schools and school children all over America tonight are receiving Federal\nassistance to go to good schools.</p>\n\n<p>Preschool education--Head Start--is already here to stay and, I think, so\nare the Federal programs that tonight are keeping more than a million and a\nhalf of the cream of our young people in the colleges and the universities\nof this country.</p>\n\n<p>Part of the American earth--not only in description on a map, but in the\nreality of our shores, our hills, our parks, our forests, and our\nmountains--has been permanently set aside for the American public and for\ntheir benefit. And there is more that will be set aside before this\nadministration ends.</p>\n\n<p>Five million Americans have been trained for jobs in new Federal programs.</p>\n\n<p>I think it is most important that we all realize tonight that this Nation\nis close to full employment--with less unemployment than we have had at any\ntime in almost 20 years. That is not in theory; that is in fact. Tonight,\nthe unemployment rate is down to 3.3 percent. The number of jobs has grown\nmore than 8 1/2 million in the last 5 years. That is more than in all the\npreceding 12 years.</p>\n\n<p>These achievements completed the full cycle, from idea to enactment and,\nfinally, to a place in the lives of citizens all across this country.</p>\n\n<p>I wish it were possible to say that everything that this Congress and the\nadministration achieved during this period had already completed that\ncycle. But a great deal of what we have committed needs additional funding\nto become a tangible realization.</p>\n\n<p>Yet the very existence of these commitments--these promises to the American\npeople, made by this Congress and by the executive branch of the\nGovernment--are achievements in themselves, and failure to carry through on\nour commitments would be a tragedy for this Nation.</p>\n\n<p>This much is certain: No one man or group of men made these commitments\nalone. Congress and the executive branch, with their checks and balances,\nreasoned together and finally wrote them into the law of the land. They now\nhave all the moral force that the American political system can summon when\nit acts as one.</p>\n\n<p>They express America\'s common determination to achieve goals. They imply\naction.</p>\n\n<p>In most cases, you have already begun that action--but it is not fully\ncompleted, of course.</p>\n\n<p>Let me speak for a moment about these commitments. I am going to speak in\nthe language which the Congress itself spoke when it passed these measures.\nI am going to quote from your words.</p>\n\n<p>In 1966, Congress declared that "improving the quality of urban life is the\nmost critical domestic problem facing the United States." Two years later\nit affirmed the historic goal of "a decent home . . . for every American\nfamily." That is your language.</p>\n\n<p>Now to meet these commitments, we must increase our support for the model\ncities program, where blueprints of change are already being prepared in\nmore than 150 American cities.</p>\n\n<p>To achieve the goals of the Housing Act of 1968 that you have already\npassed, we should begin this year more than 500,000 homes for needy\nfamilies in the coming fiscal year. Funds are provided in the new budget to\ndo just this. This is almost 10 times--10 times--the average rate of the\npast 10 years.</p>\n\n<p>Our cities and our towns are being pressed for funds to meet the needs of\ntheir growing populations. So I believe an urban development bank should be\ncreated by the Congress. This bank could obtain resources through the\nissuance of taxable bonds and it could then lend these resources at reduced\nrates to the communities throughout the land for schools, hospitals, parks,\nand other public facilities.</p>\n\n<p>Since we enacted the Social Security Act back in 1935, Congress has\nrecognized the necessity to "make more adequate provision for aged persons\n. . . through maternal and child welfare . . . and public health." Those\nare the words of the Congress--"more adequate."</p>\n\n<p>The time has come, I think, to make it more adequate. I believe we should\nincrease social security benefits, and I am so recommending tonight.</p>\n\n<p>I am suggesting that there should be an overall increase in benefits of at\nleast 13 percent. Those who receive only the minimum of $55 should get $80\na month.</p>\n\n<p>Our Nation, too, is rightfully proud of our medical advances. But we should\nremember that our country ranks 15th among the nations of the world in its\ninfant mortality rate.</p>\n\n<p>I think we should assure decent medical care for every expectant mother and\nfor their children during the first year of their life in the United States\nof America.</p>\n\n<p>I think we should protect our children and their families from the costs of\ncatastrophic illness.</p>\n\n<p>As we pass on from medicine, I think nothing is clearer to the Congress\nthan the commitment that the Congress made to end poverty. Congress\nexpressed it well, I think, in 1964, when they said: "It is the policy of\nthe United States to eliminate the paradox of poverty in the midst of\nplenty in this nation."</p>\n\n<p>This is the richest nation in the world. The antipoverty program has had\nmany achievements. It also has some failures. But we must not cripple it\nafter only 3 years of trying to solve the human problems that have been\nwith us and have been building up among us for generations.</p>\n\n<p>I believe the Congress this year will want to improve the administration of\nthe poverty program by reorganizing portions of it and transferring them to\nother agencies. I believe, though, it will want to continue, until we have\nbroken the back of poverty, the efforts we are now making throughout this\nland.</p>\n\n<p>I believe, and I hope the next administration--I believe they believe--that\nthe key to success in this effort is jobs. It is work for people who want\nto work.</p>\n\n<p>In the budget for fiscal 1970, I shall recommend a total of $3.5 billion\nfor our job training program, and that is five times as much as we spent in\n1964 trying to prepare Americans where they can work to earn their own\nliving.</p>\n\n<p>The Nation\'s commitment in the field of civil rights began with the\nDeclaration of Independence. They were extended by the 13th, 14th, and 15th\namendments. They have been powerfully strengthened by the enactment of\nthree far-reaching civil rights laws within the past 5 years, that this\nCongress, in its wisdom, passed.</p>\n\n<p>On January 1 of this year, the Fair Housing Act of 1968 covered over 20\nmillion American homes and apartments. The prohibition against racial\ndiscrimination in that act should be remembered and it should be vigorously\nenforced throughout this land.</p>\n\n<p>I believe we should also extend the vital provisions of the Voting Rights\nAct for another 5 years.</p>\n\n<p>In the Safe Streets Act of 1968, Congress determined "To assist state and\nlocal governments in reducing the incidence of crime."</p>\n\n<p>This year I am proposing that the Congress provide the full $300 million\nthat the Congress last year authorized to do just that.</p>\n\n<p>I hope the Congress will put the money where the authorization is.</p>\n\n<p>I believe this is an essential contribution to justice and to public order\nin the United States. I hope these grants can be made to the States and\nthey can be used effectively to reduce the crime rate in this country.</p>\n\n<p>But all of this is only a small part of the total effort that must be\nmade--I think chiefly by the local governments throughout the Nation--if we\nexpect to reduce the toll of crime that we all detest.</p>\n\n<p>Frankly, as I leave the Office of the Presidency, one of my greatest\ndisappointments is our failure to secure passage of a licensing and\nregistration act for firearms. I think if we had passed that act, it would\nhave reduced the incidence of crime. I believe that the Congress should\nadopt such a law, and I hope that it will at a not too distant date.</p>\n\n<p>In order to meet our long-standing commitment to make government as\nefficient as possible, I believe that we should reorganize our postal\nsystem along the lines of the Kappel[1] report.</p>\n\n<p>[Footnote 1: Frederick R. Kappel, Chairman of the Commission on Executive,\nLegislative and Judicial Salaries.]</p>\n\n<p>I hope we can all agree that public service should never impose an\nunreasonable financial sacrifice on able men and women who want to serve\ntheir country.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that the recommendations of the Commission on Executive,\nLegislative and Judicial Salaries are generally sound. Later this week, I\nshall submit a special message which I reviewed with the leadership this\nevening containing a proposal that has been reduced and has modified the\nCommission\'s recommendation to some extent on the congressional salaries.</p>\n\n<p>For Members of Congress, I will recommend the basic compensation not of the\n$50,000 unanimously recommended by the Kappel Commission and the other\ndistinguished Members, but I shall reduce that $50,000 to $42,500. I will\nsuggest that Congress appropriate a very small additional allowance for\nofficial expenses, so that Members will not be required to use their salary\nincrease for essential official business.</p>\n\n<p>I would have submitted the Commission\'s recommendations, except the advice\nthat I received from the leadership--and you usually are consulted about\nmatters that affect the Congress--was that the Congress would not accept\nthe $50,000 recommendation, and if I expected my recommendation to be\nseriously considered, I should make substantial reductions. That is the\nonly reason I didn\'t go along with the Kappel report.</p>\n\n<p>In 1967 I recommended to the Congress a fair and impartial random selection\nsystem for the draft. I submit it again tonight for your most respectful\nconsideration.</p>\n\n<p>I know that all of us recognize that most of the things we do to meet all\nof these commitments I talk about will cost money. If we maintain the\nstrong rate of growth that we have had in this country for the past 8\nyears, I think we shall generate the resources that we need to meet these\ncommitments.</p>\n\n<p>We have already been able to increase our support for major social\nprograms--although we have heard a lot about not being able to do anything\non the home front because of Vietnam; but we have been able in the last\n5 years to increase our commitments for such things as health and education\nfrom $30 billion in 1964 to $68 billion in the coming fiscal year. That is\nmore than double. That is more than it has ever been increased in the 188\nyears of this Republic, notwithstanding Vietnam.</p>\n\n<p>We must continue to budget our resources and budget them responsibly in a\nway that will preserve our prosperity and will strengthen our dollar.</p>\n\n<p>Greater revenues and the reduced Federal spending required by Congress last\nyear have changed the budgetary picture dramatically since last January\nwhen we made our estimates. At that time, you will remember that we\nestimated we would have a deficit of $8 billion. Well, I am glad to report\nto you tonight that the fiscal year ending June 30, 1969, this June, we are\ngoing to have not a deficit, but we are going to have a $2.4 billion\nsurplus.</p>\n\n<p>You will receive the budget tomorrow. The budget for the next fiscal year,\nthat begins July 1--which you will want to examine very carefully in the\ndays ahead--will provide a $3.4 billion surplus.</p>\n\n<p>This budget anticipates the extension of the surtax that Congress enacted\nlast year. I have communicated with the President-elect, Mr. Nixon, in\nconnection with this policy of continuing the surtax for the time being.</p>\n\n<p>I want to tell you that both of us want to see it removed just as soon as\ncircumstances will permit, but the President-elect has told me that he has\nconcluded that until his administration, and this Congress, can examine the\nappropriation bills, and each item in the budget, and can ascertain that\nthe facts justify permitting the surtax to expire or to be reduced, he, Mr.\nNixon, will support my recommendation that the surtax be continued.</p>\n\n<p>Americans, I believe, are united in the hope that the Paris talks will\nbring an early peace to Vietnam. And if our hopes for an early settlement\nof the war are realized, then our military expenditures can be reduced and\nvery substantial savings can be made to be used for other desirable\npurposes, as the Congress may determine.</p>\n\n<p>In any event, I think it is imperative that we do all that we responsibly\ncan to resist inflation while maintaining our prosperity. I think all\nAmericans know that our prosperity is broad and it is deep, and it has\nbrought record profits, the highest in our history, and record wages.</p>\n\n<p>Our gross national product has grown more in the last 5 years than any\nother period in our Nation\'s history. Our wages have been the highest. Our\nprofits have been the best. This prosperity has enabled millions to escape\nthe poverty that they would have otherwise had the last few years.</p>\n\n<p>I think also you will be very glad to hear that the Secretary of the\nTreasury informs me tonight that in 1968 in our balance of payments we have\nachieved a surplus. It appears that we have, in fact, done better this year\nthan we have done in any year in this regard since the year 1957.</p>\n\n<p>The quest for a durable peace, I think, has absorbed every administration\nsince the end of World War II. It has required us to seek a limitation of\narms races not only among the superpowers, but among the smaller nations as\nwell. We have joined in the test ban treaty of 1963, the outer space treaty\nof 1967, and the treaty against the spread of nuclear weapons in 1968.</p>\n\n<p>This latter agreement--the nonproliferation treaty--is now pending in the\nSenate and it has been pending there since last July. In my opinion, delay\nin ratifying it is not going to be helpful to the cause of peace. America\ntook the lead in negotiating this treaty and America should now take steps\nto have it approved at the earliest possible date.</p>\n\n<p>Until a way can be found to scale down the level of arms among the\nsuperpowers, mankind cannot view the future without fear and great\napprehension. So, I believe that we should resume the talks with the Soviet\nUnion about limiting offensive and defensive missile systems. I think they\nwould already have been resumed except for Czechoslovakia and our election\nthis year.</p>\n\n<p>It was more than 20 years ago that we embarked on a program of trying to\naid the developing nations. We knew then that we could not live in good\nconscience as a rich enclave on an earth that was seething in misery.</p>\n\n<p>During these years there have been great advances made under our program,\nparticularly against want and hunger, although we are disappointed at the\nappropriations last year. We thought they were woefully inadequate. This\nyear I am asking for adequate funds for economic assistance in the hope\nthat we can further peace throughout the world.</p>\n\n<p>I think we must continue to support efforts in regional cooperation. Among\nthose efforts, that of Western Europe has a very special place in America\'s\nconcern.</p>\n\n<p>The only course that is going to permit Europe to play the great world role\nthat its resources permit is to go forward to unity. I think America\nremains ready to work with a united Europe, to work as a partner on the\nbasis of equality.</p>\n\n<p>For the future, the quest for peace, I believe, requires:</p>\n\n<p>--that we maintain the liberal trade policies that have helped us become\nthe leading nation in world trade,</p>\n\n<p>--that we strengthen the international monetary system as an instrument of\nworld prosperity, and</p>\n\n<p>--that we seek areas of agreement with the Soviet Union where the interests\nof both nations and the interests of world peace are properly served.</p>\n\n<p>The strained relationship between us and the world\'s leading Communist\npower has not ended--especially in the light of the brutal invasion of\nCzechoslovakia. But totalitarianism is no less odious to us because we are\nable to reach some accommodation that reduces the danger of world\ncatastrophe.</p>\n\n<p>What we do, we do in the interest of peace in the world. We earnestly hope\nthat time will bring a Russia that is less afraid of diversity and\nindividual freedom.</p>\n\n<p>The quest for peace tonight continues in Vietnam, and in the Paris talks.</p>\n\n<p>I regret more than any of you know that it has not been possible to restore\npeace to South Vietnam.</p>\n\n<p>The prospects, I think, for peace are better today than at any time since\nNorth Vietnam began its invasion with its regular forces more than 4 years\nago.</p>\n\n<p>The free nations of Asia know what they were not sure of at that time: that\nAmerica cares about their freedom, and it also cares about America\'s own\nvital interests in Asia and throughout the Pacific.</p>\n\n<p>The North Vietnamese know that they cannot achieve their aggressive\npurposes by force. There may be hard fighting before a settlement is\nreached; but, I can assure you, it will yield no victory to the Communist\ncause.</p>\n\n<p>I cannot speak to you tonight about Vietnam without paying a very personal\ntribute to the men who have carried the battle out there for all of us. I\nhave been honored to be their Commander in Chief. The Nation owes them its\nunstinting support while the battle continues--and its enduring gratitude\nwhen their service is done.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the quest for stable peace in the Middle East goes on in many\ncapitals tonight. America fully supports the unanimous resolution of the\nU.N. Security Council which points the way. There must be a settlement of\nthe armed hostility that exists in that region of the world today. It is a\nthreat not only to Israel and to all the Arab States, but it is a threat to\nevery one of us and to the entire world as well.</p>\n\n<p>Now, my friends in Congress, I want to conclude with a few very personal\nwords to you.</p>\n\n<p>I rejected and rejected and then finally accepted the congressional\nleadership\'s invitation to come here to speak this farewell to you in\nperson tonight.</p>\n\n<p>I did that for two reasons. One was philosophical. I wanted to give you my\njudgment, as I saw it, on some of the issues before our Nation, as I view\nthem, before I leave.</p>\n\n<p>The other was just pure sentimental. Most all of my life as a public\nofficial has been spent here in this building. For 38 years--since I worked\non that gallery as a doorkeeper in the House of Representatives--I have\nknown these halls, and I have known most of the men pretty well who walked\nthem.</p>\n\n<p>I know the questions that you face. I know the conflicts that you endure. I\nknow the ideals that you seek to serve.</p>\n\n<p>I left here first to become Vice President, and then to become, in a moment\nof tragedy, the President of the United States.</p>\n\n<p>My term of office has been marked by a series of challenges, both at home\nand throughout the world.</p>\n\n<p>In meeting some of these challenges, the Nation has found a new confidence.\nIn meeting others, it knew turbulence and doubt, and fear and hate.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout this time, I have been sustained by my faith in representative\ndemocracy--a faith that I had learned here in this Capitol Building as an\nemployee and as a Congressman and as a Senator.</p>\n\n<p>I believe deeply in the ultimate purposes of this Nation--described by the\nConstitution, tempered by history, embodied in progressive laws, and given\nlife by men and women that have been elected to serve their fellow\ncitizens.</p>\n\n<p>Now for 5 most demanding years in the White House, I have been strengthened\nby the counsel and the cooperation of two great former Presidents, Harry S.\nTruman and Dwight David Eisenhower. I have been guided by the memory of my\npleasant and close association with the beloved John F. Kennedy, and with\nour greatest modern legislator, Speaker Sam Rayburn.</p>\n\n<p>I have been assisted by my friend every step of the way, Vice President\nHubert Humphrey. I am so grateful that I have been supported daily by the\nloyalty of Speaker McCormack and Majority Leader Albert.</p>\n\n<p>I have benefited from the wisdom of Senator Mike Mansfield, and I am sure\nthat I have avoided many dangerous pitfalls by the good commonsense counsel\nof the President Pro Tem of the Senate, Senator Richard Brevard Russell.</p>\n\n<p>I have received the most generous cooperation from the leaders of the\nRepublican Party in the Congress of the United States, Senator Dirksen and\nCongressman Gerald Ford, the Minority Leader.</p>\n\n<p>No President should ask for more, although I did upon occasions. But few\nPresidents have ever been blessed with so much.</p>\n\n<p>President-elect Nixon, in the days ahead, is going to need your\nunderstanding, just as I did. And he is entitled to have it. I hope every\nMember will remember that the burdens he will bear as our President, will\nbe borne for all of us. Each of us should try not to increase these burdens\nfor the sake of narrow personal or partisan advantage.</p>\n\n<p>Now, it is time to leave. I hope it may be said, a hundred years from now,\nthat by working together we helped to make our country more just, more just\nfor all of its people, as well as to insure and guarantee the blessings of\nliberty for all of our posterity.</p>\n\n<p>That is what I hope. But I believe that at least it will be said that we\ntried.\n</p>\n\t\t\t<div class="textNav"><a href="#top">^ Return to top</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>\n\t<div id="footer"><strong><em>State of the Union</em></strong> is a project\n\t\tby Brad Borevitz at <a href="http://www.onetwothree.net">onetwothree.net</a></div>\n</div>\n<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">\n</script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n_uacct = "UA-410742-1";\nurchinTracker();\n</script>\n</body>\n<!-- InstanceEnd -->\n</html>\n'
