The squadron in advance on that\nservice, under Commodore Decatur, lost not a moment after its arrival in\nthe Mediterranean in seeking the naval force of the enemy then cruising in\nthat sea, and succeeded in capturing two of his ships, one of them the\nprincipal ship, commanded by the Algerine admiral. The high character of\nthe American commander was brilliantly sustained on the occasion which\nbrought his own ship into close action with that of his adversary, as was\nthe accustomed gallantry of all the officers and men actually engaged.\nHaving prepared the way by this demonstration of American skill and\nprowess, he hastened to the port of Algiers, where peace was promptly\nyielded to his victorious force.</p>\n\n<p>In the terms stipulated the rights and honor of the United States were\nparticularly consulted by a perpetual relinquishment on the part of the Dey\nof all pretensions to tribute from them. The impressions which have thus\nbeen made, strengthened as they will have been by subsequent transactions\nwith the Regencies of Tunis and of Tripoli by the appearance of the larger\nforce which followed under Commodore Bainbridge, the chief in command of\nthe expedition, and by the judicious precautionary arrangements left by him\nin that quarter, afford a reasonable prospect of future security for the\nvaluable portion of our commerce which passes within reach of the Barbary\ncruisers.</p>\n\n<p>It is another source of satisfaction that the treaty of peace with Great\nBritain has been succeeded by a convention on the subject of commerce\nconcluded by the plenipotentiaries of the two countries. In this result a\ndisposition is manifested on the part of that nation corresponding with the\ndisposition of the United States, which it may be hoped will be improved\ninto liberal arrangements on other subjects on which the parties have\nmutual interests, or which might endanger their future harmony. Congress\nwill decide on the expediency of promoting such a sequel by giving effect\nto the measure of confining the American navigation to American sea men--a\nmeasure which, at the same time that it might have that conciliatory\ntendency, would have the further advantage of increasing the independence\nof our navigation and the resources for our maritime defense.</p>\n\n<p>In conformity with the articles in the treaty of Ghent relating to the\nIndians, as well as with a view to the tranquillity of our western and\nnorthwestern frontiers, measures were taken to establish an immediate peace\nwith the several tribes who had been engaged in hostilities against the\nUnited States. Such of them as were invited to Detroit acceded readily to a\nrenewal of the former treaties of friendship. Of the other tribes who were\ninvited to a station on the Mississippi the greater number have also\naccepted the peace offered to them. The residue, consisting of the more\ndistant tribes or parts of tribes, remain to be brought over by further\nexplanations, or by such other means as may be adapted to the dispositions\nthey may finally disclose.</p>\n\n<p>The Indian tribes within and bordering on the southern frontier, whom a\ncruel war on their part had compelled us to chastise into peace, have\nlatterly shown a restlessness which has called for preparatory measures for\nrepressing it, and for protecting the commissioners engaged in carrying the\nterms of the peace into execution.</p>\n\n<p>The execution of the act for fixing the military peace establishment has\nbeen attended with difficulties which even now can only be overcome by\nlegislative aid. The selection of officers, the payment and discharge of\nthe troops enlisted for the war, the payment of the retained troops and\ntheir reunion from detached and distant stations, the collection and\nsecurity of the public property in the Quartermaster, Commissary, and\nOrdnance departments, and the constant medical assistance required in\nhospitals and garrisons rendered a complete execution of the act\nimpracticable on the 1st of May, the period more immediately contemplated.\nAs soon, however, as circumstances would permit, and as far as it has been\npracticable consistently with the public interests, the reduction of the\nArmy has been accomplished; but the appropriations for its pay and for\nother branches of the military service having proved inadequate, the\nearliest attention to that subject will be necessary; and the expediency of\ncontinuing upon the peace establishment the staff officers who have\nhitherto been provisionally retained is also recommended to the\nconsideration of Congress.</p>\n\n<p>In the performance of the Executive duty upon this occasion there has not\nbeen wanting a just sensibility to the merits of the American Army during\nthe late war; but the obvious policy and design in fixing an efficient\nmilitary peace establishment did not afford an opportunity to distinguish\nthe aged and infirm on account of their past services nor the wounded and\ndisabled on account of their present sufferings.</p>\n\n<p>The extent of the reduction, indeed, unavoidably involved the exclusion of\nmany meritorious officers of every rank from the service of their country;\nand so equal as well as so numerous were the claims to attention that a\ndecision by the standard of comparative merit could seldom be attained.\nJudged, however, in candor by a general standard of positive merit, the\nArmy Register will, it is believed, do honor to the establishment, while\nthe case of those officers whose names are not included in it devolves with\nthe strongest interest upon the legislative authority for such provisions\nas shall be deemed the best calculated to give support and solace to the\nveteran and the invalid, to display the beneficence as well as the justice\nof the Government, and to inspire a martial zeal for the public service\nupon every future emergency.</p>\n\n<p>Although the embarrassments arising from the want of an uniform national\ncurrency have not been diminished since the adjournment of Congress, great\nsatisfaction has been derived in contemplating the revival of the public\ncredit and the efficiency of the public resources. The receipts into the\nTreasury from the various branches of revenue during the nine months ending\non the 30th of September last have been estimated at $12.5 millions; the\nissues of Treasury notes of every denomination during the same period\namounted to the sum of $14 millions, and there was also obtained upon loan\nduring the same period a sum of $9 millions, of which the sum of $6\nmillions was subscribed in cash and the sum of $3 millions in Treasury\nnotes.</p>\n\n<p>With these means, added to the sum of $1.5 millions, being the balance of\nmoney in the Treasury on the 1st day of January, there has been paid\nbetween the 1st of January and the 1st of October on account of the\nappropriations of the preceding and of the present year (exclusively of\nthe amount of the Treasury notes subscribed to the loan and of the amount\nredeemed in the payment of duties and taxes) the aggregate sum of $33.5\nmillions, leaving a balance then in the Treasury estimated at the sum of\n$3 millions. Independent, however of the arrearages due for military\nservices and supplies, it is presumed that a further sum of $5 millions,\nincluding the interest on the public debt payable on the 1st of January\nnext, will be demanded at the Treasury to complete the expenditures of\nthe present year, and for which the existing ways and means will\nsufficiently provide.</p>\n\n<p>The national debt, as it was ascertained on the 1st of October last,\namounted in the whole to the sum of $120 millions, consisting of the\nunredeemed balance of the debt contracted before the late war ($39\nmillions), the amount of the funded debt contracted in consequence of the\nwar ($64 millions), and the amount of the unfunded and floating debt,\nincluding the various issues of Treasury notes, $17 millions, which is in\ngradual course of payment.</p>\n\n<p>There will probably be some addition to the public debt upon the\nliquidation of various claims which are depending, and a conciliatory\ndisposition on the part of Congress may lead honorably and advantageously\nto an equitable arrangement of the militia expenses incurred by the several\nStates without the previous sanction or authority of the Government of the\nUnited States; but when it is considered that the new as well as the old\nportion of the debt has been contracted in the assertion of the national\nrights and independence, and when it is recollected that the public\nexpenditures, not being exclusively bestowed upon subjects of a transient\nnature, will long be visible in the number and equipments of the American\nNavy, in the military works for the defense of our harbors and our\nfrontiers, and in the supplies of our arsenals and magazines the amount\nwill bear a gratifying comparison with the objects which have been\nattained, as well as with the resources of the country.</p>\n\n<p>The arrangements of the finances with a view to the receipts and\nexpenditures of a permanent peace establishment will necessarily enter into\nthe deliberations of Congress during the present session. It is true that\nthe improved condition of the public revenue will not only afford the means\nof maintaining the faith of the Government with its creditors inviolate,\nand of prosecuting successfully the measures of the most liberal policy,\nbut will also justify an immediate alleviation of the burdens imposed by\nthe necessities of the war.</p>\n\n<p>It is, however, essential to every modification of the finances that the\nbenefits of an uniform national currency should be restored to the\ncommunity. The absence of the precious metals will, it is believed, be a\ntemporary evil, but until they can again be rendered the general medium of\nexchange it devolves on the wisdom of Congress to provide a substitute\nwhich shall equally engage the confidence and accommodate the wants of the\ncitizens throughout the Union. If the operation of the State banks can not\nproduce this result, the probable operation of a national bank will merit\nconsideration; and if neither of these expedients be deemed effectual it\nmay become necessary to ascertain the terms upon which the notes of the\nGovernment (no longer required as an instrument of credit) shall be issued\nupon motives of general policy as a common medium of circulation.</p>\n\n<p>Notwithstanding the security for future repose which the United States\nought to find in their love of peace and their constant respect for the\nrights of other nations, the character of the times particularly inculcates\nthe lesson that, whether to prevent or repel danger, we ought not to be\nunprepared for it. This consideration will sufficiently recommend to\nCongress a liberal provision for the immediate extension and gradual\ncompletion of the works of defense, both fixed and floating, on our\nmaritime frontier, and an adequate provision for guarding our inland\nfrontier against dangers to which certain portions of it may continue to be\nexposed.</p>\n\n<p>As an improvement in our military establishment, it will deserve the\nconsideration of Congress whether a corps of invalids might not be so\norganized and employed as at once to aid in the support of meritorious\nindividuals excluded by age or infirmities from the existing establishment,\nand to procure to the public the benefit of their stationary services and\nof their exemplary discipline.</p>\n\n<p>I recommend also an enlargement of the Military Academy already\nestablished, and the establishment of others in other sections of the\nUnion; and I can not press too much on the attention of Congress such a\nclassification and organization of the militia as will most effectually\nrender it the safeguard of a free state. If experience has shewn in the\nrecent splendid achievements of militia the value of this resource for the\npublic defense, it has shewn also the importance of that skill in the use\nof arms and that familiarity with the essential rules of discipline which\ncan not be expected from the regulations now in force.</p>\n\n<p>With this subject is intimately connected the necessity of accommodating\nthe laws in every respect to the great object of enabling the political\nauthority of the Union to employ promptly and effectually the physical\npower of the Union in the cases designated by the Constitution.</p>\n\n<p>The signal services which have been rendered by our Navy and the capacities\nit has developed for successful cooperation in the national defense will\ngive to that portion of the public force its full value in the eyes of\nCongress, at an epoch which calls for the constant vigilance of all\ngovernments. To preserve the ships now in a sound state, to complete those\nalready contemplated, to provide amply the imperishable materials for\nprompt augmentations, and to improve the existing arrangements into more\nadvantageous establishments for the construction, the repairs, and the\nsecurity of vessels of war is dictated by the soundest policy.</p>\n\n<p>In adjusting the duties on imports to the object of revenue the influence\nof the tariff on manufactures will necessarily present itself for\nconsideration. However wise the theory may be which leaves to the sagacity\nand interest of individuals the application of their industry and\nresources, there are in this as in other cases exceptions to the general\nrule. Besides the condition which the theory itself implies of reciprocal\nadoption by other nations, experience teaches that so many circumstances\nmust concur in introducing and maturing manufacturing establishments,\nespecially of the more complicated kinds, that a country may remain long\nwithout them, although sufficiently advanced and in some respects even\npeculiarly fitted for carrying them on with success. Under circumstances\ngiving a powerful impulse to manufacturing industry it has made among us a\nprogress and exhibited an efficiency which justify the belief that with a\nprotection not more than is due to the enterprising citizens whose\ninterests are now at stake it will become at an early day not only safe\nagainst occasional competitions from abroad, but a source of domestic\nwealth and even of external commerce.</p>\n\n<p>In selecting the branches more especially entitled to the public patronage\na preference is obviously claimed by such as will relieve the United States\nfrom a dependence on foreign supplies, ever subject to casual failures, for\narticles necessary for the public defense or connected with the primary\nwants of individuals. It will be an additional recommendation of particular\nmanufactures where the materials for them are extensively drawn from our\nagriculture, and consequently impart and insure to that great fund of\nnational prosperity and independence an encouragement which can not fail to\nbe rewarded.</p>\n\n<p>Among the means of advancing the public interest the occasion is a proper\none for recalling the attention of Congress to the great importance of\nestablishing throughout our country the roads and canals which can best be\nexecuted under the national authority. No objects within the circle of\npolitical economy so richly repay the expense bestowed on them; there are\nnone the utility of which is more universally ascertained and acknowledged;\nnone that do more honor to the governments whose wise and enlarged\npatriotism duly appreciates them. Nor is there any country which presents a\nfield where nature invites more the art of man to complete her own work for\nhis accommodation and benefit.</p>\n\n<p>These considerations are strengthened, moreover, by the political effect of\nthese facilities for intercommunication in bringing and binding more\nclosely together the various parts of our extended confederacy. Whilst the\nStates individually, with a laudable enterprise and emulation, avail\nthemselves of their local advantages by new roads, by navigable canals, and\nby improving the streams susceptible of navigation, the General Government\nis the more urged to similar undertakings, requiring a national\njurisdiction and national means, by the prospect of thus systematically\ncompleting so inestimable a work; and it is a happy reflection that any\ndefect of constitutional authority which may be encountered can be supplied\nin a mode which the Constitution itself has providently pointed out.</p>\n\n<p>The present is a favorable season also for bringing again into view the\nestablishment of a national seminary of learning within the District of\nColumbia, and with means drawn from the property therein, subject to the\nauthority of the General Government. Such an institution claims the\npatronage of Congress as a monument of their solicitude for the advancement\nof knowledge, without which the blessings of liberty can not be fully\nenjoyed or long preserved; as a model instructive in the formation of other\nseminaries; as a nursery of enlightened preceptors, and as a central resort\nof youth and genius from every part of their country, diffusing on their\nreturn examples of those national feelings, those liberal sentiments, and\nthose congenial manners which contribute cement to our Union and strength\nto the great political fabric of which that is the foundation.</p>\n\n<p>In closing this communication I ought not to repress a sensibility, in\nwhich you will unite, to the happy lot of our country and to the goodness\nof a superintending Providence, to which we are indebted for it. Whilst\nother portions of mankind are laboring under the distresses of war or\nstruggling with adversity in other forms, the United States are in the\ntranquil enjoyment of prosperous and honorable peace. In reviewing the\nscenes through which it has been attained we can rejoice in the proofs\ngiven that our political institutions, founded in human rights and framed\nfor their preservation, are equal to the severest trials of war, as well\nadapted to the ordinary periods of repose.</p>\n\n<p>As fruits of this experience and of the reputation acquired by the American\narms on the land and on the water, the nation finds itself possessed of a\ngrowing respect abroad and of a just confidence in itself, which are among\nthe best pledges for its peaceful career. Under other aspects of our\ncountry the strongest features of its flourishing condition are seen in a\npopulation rapidly increasing on a territory as productive as it is\nextensive; in a general industry and fertile ingenuity which find their\nample rewards, and in an affluent revenue which admits a reduction of the\npublic burdens without withdrawing the means of sustaining the public\ncredit, of gradually discharging the public debt, of providing for the\nnecessary defensive and precautionary establishments, and of patronizing in\nevery authorized mode undertakings conducive to the aggregate wealth and\nindividual comfort of our citizens.</p>\n\n<p>It remains for the guardians of the public welfare to persevere in that\njustice and good will toward other nations which invite a return of these\nsentiments toward the United States; to cherish institutions which\nguarantee their safety and their liberties, civil and religious; and to\ncombine with a liberal system of foreign commerce an improvement of the\nnational advantages and a protection and extension of the independent\nresources of our highly favored and happy country.</p>\n\n<p>In all measures having such objects my faithful cooperation will be\nafforded.\n</p>\n\t\t\t<div class="textNav"><a href="#top">^ Return to top</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>\n\t<div id="footer"><strong><em>State of the Union</em></strong> is a project\n\t\tby Brad Borevitz at <a href="http://www.onetwothree.net">onetwothree.net</a></div>\n</div>\n<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">\n</script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n_uacct = "UA-410742-1";\nurchinTracker();\n</script>\n</body>\n<!-- InstanceEnd -->\n</html>\n'
