Another\nyear has come around, and finds us still blessed with peace and friendship\nabroad; law, order, and religion at home; good affection and harmony with\nour Indian neighbors; our burthens lightened, yet our income sufficient for\nthe public wants, and the produce of the year great beyond example. These,\nfellow citizens, are the circumstances under which we meet, and we remark\nwith special satisfaction those which under the smiles of Providence result\nfrom the skill, industry, and order of our citizens, managing their own\naffairs in their own way and for their own use, unembarrassed by too much\nregulation, unoppressed by fiscal exactions.</p>\n\n<p>On the restoration of peace in Europe that portion of the general carrying\ntrade which had fallen to our share during the war was abridged by the\nreturning competition of the belligerent powers. This was to be expected,\nand was just. But in addition we find in some parts of Europe monopolizing\ndiscriminations, which in the form of duties tend effectually to prohibit\nthe carrying thither our own produce in our own vessels. From existing\namities and a spirit of justice it is hoped that friendly discussion will\nproduce a fair and adequate reciprocity. But should false calculations of\ninterest defeat our hope, it rests with the Legislature to decide whether\nthey will meet inequalities abroad with countervailing inequalities at\nhome, or provide for the evil in any other way.</p>\n\n<p>It is with satisfaction I lay before you an act of the British Parliament\nanticipating this subject so far as to authorize a mutual abolition of the\nduties and countervailing duties permitted under the treaty of 1794. It\nshows on their part a spirit of justice and friendly accommodation which it\nis our duty and our interest to cultivate with all nations. Whether this\nwould produce a due equality in the navigation between the two countries is\na subject for your consideration.</p>\n\n<p>Another circumstance which claims attention as directly affecting the very\nsource of our navigation is the defect or the evasion of the law providing\nfor the return of sea men, and particularly of those belonging to vessels\nsold abroad. Numbers of them, discharged in foreign ports, have been thrown\non the hands of our consuls, who, to rescue them from the dangers into\nwhich their distresses might plunge them and save them to their country,\nhave found it necessary in some cases to return them at the public charge.</p>\n\n<p>The cession of the Spanish Province of Louisiana to France, which took\nplace in the course of the late war, will, if carried into effect, make a\nchange in the aspect of our foreign relations which will doubtless have\njust weight in any deliberations of the Legislature connected with that\nsubject.</p>\n\n<p>There was reason not long since to apprehend that the warfare in which we\nwere engaged with Tripoli might be taken up by some other of the Barbary\nPowers. A reenforcement, therefore, was immediately ordered to the vessels\nalready there. Subsequent information, however, has removed these\napprehensions for the present. To secure our commerce in that sea with the\nsmallest force competent, we have supposed it best to watch strictly the\nharbor of Tripoli. Still, however, the shallowness of their coast and the\nwant of smaller vessels on our part has permitted some cruisers to escape\nunobserved, and to one of these an American vessel unfortunately fell prey.\nThe captain, one American sea man, and two others of color remain prisoners\nwith them unless exchanged under an agreement formerly made with the\nBashaw, to whom, on the faith of that, some of his captive subjects had\nbeen restored.</p>\n\n<p>The convention with the State of Georgia has been ratified by their\nlegislature, and a repurchase from the Creeks has been consequently made of\na part of the Talasscee country. In this purchase has been also\ncomprehended a part of the lands within the fork of Oconee and Oakmulgee\nrivers. The particulars of the contract will be laid before Congress so\nsoon as they shall be in a state for communication.</p>\n\n<p>In order to remove every ground of difference possible with our Indian\nneighbors, I have proceeded in the work of settling with them and marking\nthe boundaries between us. That with the Choctaw Nation is fixed in one\npart and will be through the whole within a short time. The country to\nwhich their title had been extinguished before the Revolution is sufficient\nto receive a very respectable population, which Congress will probably see\nthe expediency of encouraging so soon as the limits shall be declared. We\nare to view this position as an outpost of the United States, surrounded by\nstrong neighbors and distant from its support; and how far that monopoly\nwhich prevents population should here be guarded against and actual\nhabitation made a condition of the continuance of title will be for your\nconsideration. A prompt settlement, too, of all existing rights and claims\nwithin this territory presents itself as a preliminary operation.</p>\n\n<p>In that part of the Indiana Territory which includes Vincennes the lines\nsettled with the neighboring tribes fix the extinction of their title at a\nbreadth of 24 leagues from east to west and about the same length parallel\nwith and including the Wabash. They have also ceded a tract of 4 miles\nsquare, including the salt springs near the mouth of that river.</p>\n\n<p>In the Department of Finance it is with pleasure I inform you, that the\nreceipts of external duties for the last 12 months have exceeded those of\nany former year, and that the ration of increase has been also greater than\nusual. This has enabled us to answer all the regular exigencies of\nGovernment, to pay from the Treasury within one year upward of $8 millions,\nprincipal and interest, of the public debt, exclusive of upward of $1\nmillion paid by the sale of bank stock, and making in the whole a\nreduction of nearly $5.5 millions of principal, and to have now in the\nTreasury $4.5 millions which are in a course of application to the\nfurther discharge of debt and current demands. Experience, too, so far,\nauthorizes us to believe, if no extraordinary event supervenes, and the\nexpenses which will be actually incurred shall not be greater than were\ncontemplated by Congress at their last session, that we shall not be\ndisappointed in the expectations then formed. But nevertheless, as the\neffect of peace on the amount of duties is not yet fully ascertained, it\nis the more necessary to practice every useful economy and to incur no\nexpense which may be avoided without prejudice.</p>\n\n<p>The collection of the internal taxes having been completed in some of the\nStates, the officers employed in it are of course out of commission. In\nothers they will be so shortly. But in a few, where the arrangements for\nthe direct tax had been retarded, it will be some time before the system is\nclosed. It has not yet been thought necessary to employ the agent\nauthorized by an act of the last session for transacting business in Europe\nrelative to debts and loans. Nor have we used the power confided by the\nsame act of prolonging the foreign debt by reloans, and of redeeming\ninstead thereof an equal sum of the domestic debt. Should, however, the\ndifficulties of remittance on so large a scale render it necessary at any\ntime, the power shall be executed and the money thus employed abroad shall,\nin conformity with that law, be faithfully applied here in an equivalent\nextinction of domestic debt.</p>\n\n<p>When effects so salutary result from the plans you have already sanctioned;\nwhen merely by avoiding false objects of expense we are able, without a\ndirect tax, without internal taxes, and without borrowing to make large and\neffectual payments toward the discharge of our public debt and the\nemancipation of our posterity from that mortal canker, it is an\nencouragement, fellow citizens, of the highest order to proceed as we have\nbegun in substituting economy for taxation, and in pursuing what is useful\nfor a nation placed as we are, rather than what is practiced by others\nunder different circumstances. And when so ever we are destined to meet\nevents which shall call forth all the energies of our country-men, we have\nthe firmest reliance on those energies and the comfort of leaving for calls\nlike these the extraordinary resources of loans and internal taxes. In the\nmean time, by payments of the principal of our debt, we are liberating\nannually portions of the external taxes and forming from them a growing\nfund still further to lessen the necessity of recurring to extraordinary\nresources.</p>\n\n<p>The usual account of receipts and expenditures for the last year, with an\nestimate of the expenses of the ensuing one, will be laid before you by the\nSecretary of the Treasury.</p>\n\n<p>No change being deemed necessary in our military establishment, an estimate\nof its expenses for the ensuing year on its present footing, as also of the\nsums to be employed in fortifications and other objects within that\ndepartment, has been prepared by the Secretary of War, and will make a part\nof the general estimates which will be presented you.</p>\n\n<p>Considering that our regular troops are employed for local purposes, and\nthat the militia is our general reliance for great and sudden emergencies,\nyou will doubtless think this institution worthy of a review, and give it\nthose improvements of which you find it susceptible.</p>\n\n<p>Estimates for the Naval Department, prepared by the Secretary of the Navy,\nfor another year will in like manner be communicated with the general\nestimates. A small force in the Mediterranean will still be necessary to\nrestrain the Tripoline cruisers, and the uncertain tenure of peace with\nsome other of the Barbary Powers may eventually require that force to be\naugmented. The necessity of procuring some smaller vessels for that service\nwill raise the estimate, but the difference in their maintenance will soon\nmake it a measure of economy.</p>\n\n<p>Presuming it will be deemed expedient to expend annually a convenient sum\ntoward providing the naval defense which our situation may require, I can\nnot but recommend that the first appropriations for that purpose may go to\nthe saving what we already possess. No cares, no attentions, can preserve\nvessels from rapid decay which lie in water and exposed to the sun. These\ndecays require great and constant repairs, and will consume, if continued,\na great portion of the moneys destined to naval purposes. To avoid this\nwaste of our resources it is proposed to add to our navy-yard here a dock\nwithin which our present vessels may be laid up dry and under cover from\nthe sun. Under these circumstances experience proves that works of wood\nwill remain scarcely at all affected by time. The great abundance of\nrunning water which this situation possesses, at heights far above the\nlevel of the tide, if employed as is practiced for lock navigation,\nfurnishes the means for raising and laying up our vessels on a dry and\nsheltered bed. And should the measure be found useful here, similar\ndepositories for laying up as well as for building and repairing vessels\nmay hereafter be undertaken at other navy-yards offering the same means.\nThe plans and estimates of the work, prepared by a person of skill and\nexperience, will be presented to you without delay, and from this it will\nbe seen that scarcely more than has been the cost of one vessel is necessary\nto save the whole, and that the annual sum to be employed toward its\ncompletion may be adapted to the views of the Legislature as to naval\nexpenditure. To cultivate peace and maintain commerce and navigation in all\ntheir lawful enterprises; to foster our fisheries as nurseries of\nnavigation and for the nurture of man, and protect the manufactures adapted\nto our circumstances; to preserve the faith of the nation by an exact\ndischarge of its debts and contracts, expend the public money with the same\ncare and economy we would practice with our own, and impose on our citizens\nno unnecessary burthens; to keep in all things within the pale of our\nconstitutional powers, and cherish the federal union as the only rock of\nsafety--these, fellow citizens, are the land-marks by which we are to\nguide ourselves in all proceedings. By continuing to make these the rule of\nour action we shall endear to our country-men the true principles of their\nConstitution and promote an union of sentiment and of action equally\nauspicious to their happiness and safety. On my part, you may count on a\ncordial concurrence in every measure for the public good and on all the\ninformation I possess which may enable you to discharge to advantage the\nhigh functions with which you are invested by your country.</p>\n\n<p>TH.
