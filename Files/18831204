Arthur</h2>\n\t\t\t<h3>December 4, 1883</h3>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p>\nTo the Congress of the United States:</p>\n\n<p>At the threshold of your deliberations I congratulate you upon the\nfavorable aspect of the domestic and foreign affairs of this Government.</p>\n\n<p>Our relations with other countries continue to be upon a friendly footing.\nWith the Argentine Republic, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, Hayti,\nItaly, Santo Domingo, and Sweden and Norway no incident has occurred which\ncalls for special comment. The recent opening of new lines of telegraphic\ncommunication with Central America and Brazil permitted the interchange of\nmessages of friendship with the Governments of those countries.</p>\n\n<p>During the year there have been perfected and proclaimed consular and\ncommercial treaties with Servia and a consular treaty with Roumania, thus\nextending our intercourse with the Danubian countries, while our Eastern\nrelations have been put upon a wider basis by treaties with Korea and\nMadagascar. The new boundary-survey treaty with Mexico, a trade-marks\nconvention and a supplementary treaty of extradition with Spain, and\nconventions extending the duration of the Franco-American Claims Commission\nhave also been proclaimed.</p>\n\n<p>Notice of the termination of the fisheries articles of the treaty of\nWashington was duly given to the British Government, and the reciprocal\nprivileges and exemptions of the treaty will accordingly cease on July 1,\n1885. The fisheries industries, pursued by a numerous class of our citizens\non the northern coasts, both of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, are worthy\nof the fostering care of Congress. Whenever brought into competition with\nthe like industries of other countries, our fishermen, as well as our\nmanufacturers of fishing appliances and preparers of fish products, have\nmaintained a foremost place. I suggest that Congress create a commission to\nconsider the general question of our rights in the fisheries and the means\nof opening to our citizens, under just and enduring conditions, the richly\nstocked fishing waters and sealing grounds of British North America.</p>\n\n<p>Question has arisen touching the deportation to the United States from the\nBritish Islands, by governmental or municipal aid, of persons unable there\nto gain a living and equally a burden on the community here. Such of these\npersons as fall under the pauper class as defined by law have been sent\nback in accordance with the provisions of our statutes. Her Majesty\'s\nGovernment has insisted that precautions have been taken before shipment to\nprevent these objectionable visitors from coming hither without guaranty of\nsupport by their relatives in this country. The action of the British\nauthorities in applying measures for relief has, however, in so many cases\nproved ineffectual, and especially so in certain recent instances of needy\nemigrants reaching our territory through Canada, that a revision of our\nlegislation upon this subject may be deemed advisable.</p>\n\n<p>Correspondence relative to the Clayton-Bulwer treaty has been continued and\nwill be laid before Congress.</p>\n\n<p>The legislation of France against the importation of prepared swine\nproducts from the United States has been repealed. That result is due no\nless to the friendly representations of this Government than to a growing\nconviction in France that the restriction was not demanded by any real\ndanger to health.</p>\n\n<p>Germany still prohibits the introduction of all swine products from\nAmerica. I extended to the Imperial Government a friendly invitation to\nsend experts to the United States to inquire whether the use of those\nproducts was dangerous to health. This invitation was declined. I have\nbelieved it of such importance, however, that the exact facts should be\nascertained and promulgated that I have appointed a competent commission to\nmake a thorough investigation of the subject. Its members have shown their\npublic spirit by accepting their trust without pledge of compensation, but\nI trust that Congress will see in the national and international bearings\nof the matter a sufficient motive for providing at least for reimbursement\nof such expenses as they may necessarily incur.</p>\n\n<p>The coronation of the Czar at Moscow afforded to this Government an\noccasion for testifying its continued friendship by sending a special envoy\nand a representative of the Navy to attend the ceremony.</p>\n\n<p>While there have arisen during the year no grave questions affecting the\nstatus in the Russian Empire of American citizens of other faith than that\nheld by the national church, this Government remains firm in its conviction\nthat the rights of its citizens abroad should be in no wise affected by\ntheir religious belief.</p>\n\n<p>It is understood that measures for the removal of the restrictions which\nnow burden our trade with Cuba and Puerto Rico are under consideration by\nthe Spanish Government.</p>\n\n<p>The proximity of Cuba to the United States and the peculiar methods of\nadministration which there prevail necessitate constant discussion and\nappeal on our part from the proceedings of the insular authorities. I\nregret to say that the just protests of this Government have not as yet\nproduced satisfactory results.</p>\n\n<p>The commission appointed to decide certain claims of our citizens against\nthe Spanish Government, after the recognition of a satisfactory rule as to\nthe validity and force of naturalization in the United States, has finally\nadjourned. Some of its awards, though made more than two years ago, have\nnot yet been paid. Their speedy payment is expected.</p>\n\n<p>Claims to a large amount which were held by the late commission to be\nwithout its jurisdiction have been diplomatically presented to the Spanish\nGovernment. As the action of the colonial authorities which has given rise\nto these claims was admittedly illegal, full reparation for the injury\nsustained by our citizens should be no longer delayed.</p>\n\n<p>The case of the Masonic has not yet reached a settlement. Manila court has\nfound that the proceedings of which this Government has complained were\nunauthorized, and it is hoped that the Government of Spain will not\nwithhold the speedy reparation which its sense of justice should impel it\nto offer for the unusual severity and unjust action of its subordinate\ncolonial officers in the case of this vessel.</p>\n\n<p>The Helvetian Confederation has proposed the inauguration of a class of\ninternational treaties for the referment to arbitration of grave questions\nbetween nations. This Government has assented to the proposed negotiation\nof such a treaty with Switzerland.</p>\n\n<p>Under the treaty of Berlin liberty of conscience and civil rights are\nassured to all strangers in Bulgaria. As the United States have no distinct\nconventional relations with that country and are not a party to the treaty,\nthey should, in my opinion, maintain diplomatic representation at Sofia for\nthe improvement of intercourse and the proper protection of the many\nAmerican citizens who resort to that country as missionaries and teachers.\nI suggest that I be given authority to establish an agency and\nconsulate-general at the Bulgarian capital.</p>\n\n<p>The United States are now participating in a revision of the tariffs of the\nOttoman Empire. They have assented to the application of a license tax to\nforeigners doing business in Turkey, but have opposed the oppressive\nstorage tax upon petroleum entering the ports of that country.</p>\n\n<p>The Government of the Khedive has proposed that the authority of the mixed\njudicial tribunals in Egypt be extended so as to cover citizens of the\nUnited States accused of crime, who are now triable before consular courts.\nThis Government is not indisposed to accept the change, but believes that\nits terms should be submitted for criticism to the commission appointed to\nrevise the whole subject.</p>\n\n<p>At no time in our national history has there been more manifest need of\nclose and lasting relations with a neighboring state than now exists with\nrespect to Mexico. The rapid influx of our capital and enterprise into that\ncountry shows, by what has already been accomplished, the vast reciprocal\nadvantages which must attend the progress of its internal development. The\ntreaty of commerce and navigation of 1848 has been terminated by the\nMexican Government, and in the absence of conventional engagements the\nrights of our citizens in Mexico now depend upon the domestic statutes of\nthat Republic. There have been instances of harsh enforcement of the laws\nagainst our vessels and citizens in Mexico and of denial of the diplomatic\nresort for their protection. The initial step toward a better understanding\nhas been taken in the negotiation by the commission authorized by Congress\nof a treaty which is still before the Senate awaiting its approval.</p>\n\n<p>The provisions for the reciprocal crossing of the frontier by the troops in\npursuit of hostile Indians have been prolonged for another year. The\noperations of the forces of both Governments against these savages have\nbeen successful, and several of their most dangerous bands have been\ncaptured or dispersed by the skill and valor of United States and Mexican\nsoldiers fighting in a common cause.</p>\n\n<p>The convention for the resurvey of the boundary from the Rio Grande to the\nPacific having been ratified and exchanged, the preliminary reconnoissance\ntherein stipulated has been effected. It now rests with Congress to make\nprovision for completing the survey and relocating the boundary monuments.</p>\n\n<p>A convention was signed with Mexico on July 13, 1882, providing for the\nrehearing of the cases of Benjamin Well and the Abra Silver Mining Company,\nin whose favor awards were made by the late American and Mexican Claims\nCommission. That convention still awaits the consent of the Senate.\nMeanwhile, because of those charges of fraudulent awards which have made a\nnew commission necessary, the Executive has directed the suspension of\npayments of the distributive quota received from Mexico.</p>\n\n<p>Our geographical proximity to Central America and our political and\ncommercial relations with the States of that country justify, in my\njudgment, such a material increase of our consular corps as will place at\neach capital a consul-general.</p>\n\n<p>The contest between Bolivia, Chile, and Peru has passed from the stage of\nstrategic hostilities to that of negotiation, in which the counsels of this\nGovernment have been exercised. The demands of Chile for absolute cession\nof territory have been maintained and accepted by the party of General\nIglesias to the extent of concluding a treaty of peace with the Government\nof Chile in general conformity with the terms of the protocol signed in May\nlast between the Chilean commander and General Iglesias. As a result of the\nconclusion of this treaty General Iglesias has been formally recognized by\nChile as President of Peru and his government installed at Lima, which has\nbeen evacuated by the Chileans. A call has been issued by General Iglesias\nfor a representative assembly, to be elected on the 13th of January, and to\nmeet at Lima on the 1st of March next. Meanwhile the provisional government\nof General Iglesias has applied for recognition to the principal powers of\nAmerica and Europe. When the will of the Peruvian people shall be\nmanifested, I shall not hesitate to recognize the government approved by\nthem.</p>\n\n<p>Diplomatic and naval representatives of this Government attended at Caracas\nthe centennial celebration of the birth of the illustrious Bolivar. At the\nsame time the inauguration of the statue of Washington in the Venezuelan\ncapital testified to the veneration in which his memory is there held.</p>\n\n<p>Congress at its last session authorized the Executive to propose to\nVenezuela a reopening of the awards of the mixed commission of Caracas. The\ndeparture from this country of the Venezuelan minister has delayed the\nopening of negotiations for reviving the commission. This Government holds\nthat until the establishment of a treaty upon this subject the Venezuelan\nGovernment must continue to make the payments provided for in the\nconvention of 1866.</p>\n\n<p>There is ground for believing that the dispute growing out of the unpaid\nobligations due from Venezuela to France will be satisfactorily adjusted.\nThe French cabinet has proposed a basis of settlement which meets my\napproval, but as it involves a recasting of the annual quotas of the\nforeign debt it has been deemed advisable to submit the proposal to the\njudgment of the cabinets of Berlin, Copenhagen, The Hague, London, and\nMadrid.</p>\n\n<p>At the recent coronation of His Majesty King Kalakaua this Government was\nrepresented both diplomatically and by the formal visit of a vessel of\nwar.</p>\n\n<p>The question of terminating or modifying the existing reciprocity treaty\nwith Hawaii is now before Congress. I am convinced that the charges of\nabuses and frauds under that treaty have been exaggerated, and I renew the\nsuggestion of last year\'s message that the treaty be modified wherever its\nprovisions have proved onerous to legitimate trade between the two\ncountries. I am not disposed to favor the entire cessation of the treaty\nrelations which have fostered good will between the countries and\ncontributed toward the equality of Hawaii in the family of nations.</p>\n\n<p>In pursuance of the policy declared by this Government of extending our\nintercourse with the Eastern nations, legations have during the past year\nbeen established in Persia, Siam, and Korea. It is probable that permanent\nmissions of those countries will ere long be maintained in the United\nStates. A special embassy from Siam is now on its way hither.</p>\n\n<p>Treaty relations with Korea were perfected by the exchange at Seoul, on the\n19th of May last, of the ratifications of the lately concluded convention,\nand envoys from the King of Chosen have visited this country and\nreceived a cordial welcome. Korea, as yet unacquainted with the methods of\nWestern civilization, now invites the attention of those interested in the\nadvancement of our foreign trade, as it needs the implements and products\nwhich the United States are ready to supply. We seek no monopoly of its\ncommerce and no advantages over other nations, but as the Chosenese, in\nreaching for a higher civilization, have confided in this Republic, we can\nnot regard with indifference any encroachment on their rights.</p>\n\n<p>China, by the payment of a money indemnity, has settled certain of the\nlong-pending claims of our citizens, and I have strong hopes that the\nremainder will soon be adjusted.</p>\n\n<p>Questions have arisen touching the rights of American and other foreign\nmanufacturers in China under the provisions of treaties which permit aliens\nto exercise their industries in that country. On this specific point our\nown treaty is silent, but under the operation of the most-favored-nation\nclause we have like privileges with those of other powers. While it is the\nduty of the Government to see that our citizens have the full enjoyment of\nevery benefit secured by treaty, I doubt the expediency of leading in a\nmovement to constrain China to admit an interpretation which we have only\nan indirect treaty right to exact. The transference to China of American\ncapital for the employment there of Chinese labor would in effect\ninaugurate a competition for the control of markets now supplied by our\nhome industries.</p>\n\n<p>There is good reason to believe that the law restricting the immigration of\nChinese has been violated, intentionally or otherwise, by the officials of\nChina upon whom is devolved the duty of certifying that the immigrants\nbelong to the excepted classes.</p>\n\n<p>Measures have been taken to ascertain the facts incident to this supposed\ninfraction, and it is believed that the Government of China will cooperate\nwith the United States in securing the faithful observance of the law.</p>\n\n<p>The same considerations which prompted Congress at its last session to\nreturn to Japan the Simonoseki indemnity seem to me to require at its hands\nlike action in respect to the Canton indemnity fund, now amounting to\n$300,000.</p>\n\n<p>The question of the general revision of the foreign treaties of Japan has\nbeen considered in an international conference held at Tokyo, but without\ndefinite result as yet. This Government is disposed to concede the requests\nof Japan to determine its own tariff duties, to provide such proper\njudicial tribunals as may commend themselves to the Western powers for the\ntrial of causes to which foreigners are parties, and to assimilate the\nterms and duration of its treaties to those of other civilized states.</p>\n\n<p>Through our ministers at London and at Monrovia this Government has\nendeavored to aid Liberia in its differences with Great Britain touching\nthe northwestern boundary of that Republic. There is a prospect of\nadjustment of the dispute by the adoption of the Mannah River as the line.\nThis arrangement is a compromise of the conflicting territorial claims and\ntakes from Liberia no country over which it has maintained effective\njurisdiction.</p>\n\n<p>The rich and populous valley of the Kongo is being opened to commerce by a\nsociety called the International African Association, of which the King of\nthe Belgians is the president and a citizen of the United States the chief\nexecutive officer. Large tracts of territory have been ceded to the\nassociation by native chiefs, roads have been opened, steamboats placed on\nthe river, and the nuclei of states established at twenty-two stations\nunder one flag which offers freedom to commerce and prohibits the slave\ntrade. The objects of the society are philanthropic. It does not aim at\npermanent political control, but seeks the neutrality of the valley. The\nUnited States can not be indifferent to this work nor to the interests of\ntheir citizens involved in it. It may become advisable for us to cooperate\nwith other commercial powers in promoting the rights of trade and residence\nin the Kongo Valley free from the interference or political control of any\none nation.</p>\n\n<p>In view of the frequency of invitations from foreign governments to\nparticipate in social and scientific congresses for the discussion of\nimportant matters of general concern, I repeat the suggestion of my last\nmessage that provision be made for the exercise of discretionary power by\nthe Executive in appointing delegates to such convocations. Able\nspecialists are ready to serve the national interests in such capacity\nwithout personal profit or other compensation than the defrayment of\nexpenses actually incurred, and this a comparatively small annual\nappropriation would suffice to meet.</p>\n\n<p>I have alluded in my previous messages to the injurious and vexatious\nrestrictions suffered by our trade in the Spanish West Indies. Brazil,\nwhose natural outlet for its great national staple, coffee, is in and\nthrough the United States, imposes a heavy export duty upon that product.\nOur petroleum exports are hampered in Turkey and in other Eastern ports by\nrestrictions as to storage and by onerous taxation. For these mischiefs\nadequate relief is not always afforded by reciprocity treaties like that\nwith Hawaii or that lately negotiated with Mexico and now awaiting the\naction of the Senate. Is it not advisable to provide some measure of\nequitable retaliation in our relations with governments which discriminate\nagainst our own? If, for example, the Executive were empowered to apply to\nSpanish vessels and cargoes from Cuba and Puerto Rico the same rules of\ntreatment and scale of penalties for technical faults which are applied to\nour vessels and cargoes in the Antilles, a resort to that course might not\nbe barren of good results.</p>\n\n<p>The report of the Secretary of the Treasury gives a full and interesting\nexhibit of the financial condition of the country.</p>\n\n<p>It shows that the ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year\nended June 30, 1883, amounted to $398,287,581.95, whereof there was\nreceived--</p>\n\n<p>From customs -
