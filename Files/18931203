In an effort to abridge this communication\nas much as is consistent with its purpose I shall supplement a brief reference\nto the contents of these departmental reports by the mention of such executive\nbusiness and incidents as are not embraced therein and by such recommendations\nas appear to be at this particular time appropriate.</p>\n\n<p>While our foreign relations have not at all times during the past year been\nentirely free from perplexity, no embarrassing situation remains that will not\nyield to the spirit of fairness and love of justice which, joined with\nconsistent firmness, characterize a truly American foreign policy.</p>\n\n<p>My predecessor having accepted the office of arbitrator of the long-standing\nMissions boundary dispute, tendered to the President by the Argentine Republic\nand Brazil, it has been my agreeable duty to receive the special envoys\ncommissioned by those States to lay before me evidence and arguments in behalf\nof their respective Governments.</p>\n\n<p>The outbreak of domestic hostilities in the Republic of Brazil found the\nUnited States alert to watch the interests of our citizens in that country,\nwith which we carry on important commerce. Several vessels of our new Navy are\nnow and for some time have been stationed at Rio de Janeiro. The struggle\nbeing between the established Government, which controls the machinery of\nadministration, and with which we maintain friendly relations, and certain\nofficers of the navy employing the vessels of their command in an attack upon\nthe national capital and chief seaport, and lacking as it does the elements of\ndivided administration, I have failed to see that the insurgents can\nreasonably claim recognition as belligerents.</p>\n\n<p>Thus far the position of our Government has been that of an attentive but\nimpartial observer of the unfortunate conflict. Emphasizing our fixed policy\nof impartial neutrality in such a condition of affairs as now exists, I deemed\nit necessary to disavow in a manner not to be misunderstood the unauthorized\naction of our late naval commander in those waters in saluting the revolted\nBrazilian admiral, being indisposed to countenance an act calculated to give\ngratuitous sanction to the local insurrection.</p>\n\n<p>The convention between our Government and Chile having for its object the\nsettlement and adjustment of the demand of the two countries against each\nother has been made effective by he organization of the claims commission\nprovided for. The two Governments failing to agree upon the third member of\nthe commission, the good offices of the President of the Swiss Republic were\ninvoked, as provided in the treaty, and the selection of the Swiss\nrepresentative in this country to complete the organization was gratifying\nalike to the United States and Chile.</p>\n\n<p>The vexatious question of so-called legation asylum for offenders against the\nstate and its laws was presented anew in Chile by the unauthorized action of\nthe late United States minister in receiving into his official residence two\npersons who had just failed in an attempt at revolution and against whom\ncriminal charges were pending growing out of a former abortive disturbance.\nThe doctrine of asylum as applied to this case is not sanctioned by the best\nprecedents, and when allowed tends to encourage sedition and strife. Under no\ncircumstances can the representatives of this Government be permitted, under\nthe ill-defined fiction of extraterritoriality, to interrupt the\nadministration of criminal justice in the countries to which they are\naccredited. A temperate demand having been made by the Chilean Government for\nthe correction of this conduct in the instance mentioned, the minister was\ninstructed no longer to harbor the offenders.</p>\n\n<p>The legislation of last year known as the Geary law, requiring the\nregistration of all Chinese laborers entitled to residence in the United\nStates and the deportation of all not complying with the provisions of the act\nwithin the time prescribed, met with much opposition from Chinamen in this\ncountry. Acting upon the advice of eminent counsel that the law was\nunconstitutional, the great mass of Chinese laborers, pending judicial inquiry\nas to its validity, in good faith declined to apply for the certificates\nrequired by its provisions. A test case upon proceeding by habeas corpus was\nbrought before the Supreme Court, and on May 15, 1893, a decision was made by\nthat tribunal sustaining the law.</p>\n\n<p>It is believed that under the recent amendment of the act extending the time\nfor registration the Chinese laborers thereto entitled who desire to reside in\nthis country will now avail themselves of the renewed privilege thus afforded\nof establishing by lawful procedure their right to remain, and that thereby\nthe necessity of enforced deportation may to a great degree be avoided.</p>\n\n<p>It has devolved upon the United States minister at Peking, as dean of the\ndiplomatic body, and in the absence of a representative of Sweden and Norway,\nto press upon the Chinese Government reparation for the recent murder of\nSwedish missionaries at Sung-pu. This question is of vital interest to all\ncountries whose citizens engage in missionary work in the interior.</p>\n\n<p>By Article XII of the general act of Brussels, signed July 2, 1890, for the\nsuppression of the slave trade and the restriction of certain injurious\ncommerce in the Independent State of the Kongo and in the adjacent zone of\ncentral Africa, the United States and the other signatory powers agreed to\nadopt appropriate means for the punishment of persons selling arms and\nammunition to the natives and for the confiscation of the inhibited articles.\nIt being the plain duty of this Government to aid in suppressing the nefarious\ntraffic, impairing as it does the praiseworthy and civilizing efforts now in\nprogress in that region, I recommend that an act be passed prohibiting the\nsale of arms and intoxicants to natives in the regulated zone by our citizens.</p>\n\n<p>Costa Rica has lately testified its friendliness by surrendering to the United\nStates, in the absence of a convention of extradition, but upon duly submitted\nevidence of criminality, a noted fugitive from justice. It is trusted that the\nnegotiation of a treaty with that country to meet recurring cases of this kind\nwill soon be accomplished. In my opinion treaties for reciprocal extradition\nshould be concluded with all those countries with which the United States has\nnot already conventional arrangements of that character.</p>\n\n<p>I have deemed it fitting to express to the Governments of Costa Rica and\nColombia the kindly desire of the United States to see their pending boundary\ndispute finally closed by arbitration in conformity with the spirit of the\ntreaty concluded between them some years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Our relations with the French Republic continue to be intimate and cordial. I\nsincerely hope that the extradition treaty with that country, as amended by\nthe Senate, will soon be operative.</p>\n\n<p>While occasional questions affecting our naturalized citizens returning to the\nland of their birth have arisen in our intercourse with Germany, our relations\nwith that country continue satisfactory.</p>\n\n<p>The questions affecting our relations with Great Britain have been treated in\na spirit of friendliness.</p>\n\n<p>Negotiations are in progress between the two Governments with a view to such\nconcurrent action as will make the award and regulations agreed upon by the\nBering Sea Tribunal of Arbitration practically effective, and it is not\ndoubted that Great Britain will cooperate freely with this country for the\naccomplishment of that purpose.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute growing out of the discriminating tolls imposed in the Welland\nCanal upon cargoes of cereals bound to and from the lake ports of the United\nStates was adjusted by the substitution of a more equitable schedule of\ncharges, and my predecessor thereupon suspended his proclamation imposing\ndiscriminating tolls upon British transit through our canals.</p>\n\n<p>A request for additions to the list of extraditable offenses covered by the\nexisting treaty between the two countries is under consideration.</p>\n\n<p>During the past year an American citizen employed in a subordinate commercial\nposition in Hayti, after suffering a protracted imprisonment on an unfounded\ncharge of smuggling, was finally liberated on judicial examination. Upon\nurgent representation to the Haytian Government a suitable indemnity was paid\nto the sufferer.</p>\n\n<p>By a law of Hayti a sailing vessel, having discharged her cargo, is refused\nclearance until the duties on such cargo have been paid. The hardship of this\nmeasure upon American shipowners, who conduct the bulk of the carrying trade\nof that country, has been insisted on with a view of securing the removal of\nthis cause of complaint.</p>\n\n<p>Upon receiving authentic information of the firing upon an American mail\nsteamer touching at the port of Amapala because her captain refused to deliver\nup a passenger in transit from Nicaragua to Guatemala upon demand of the\nmilitary authorities of Honduras, our minister to that country, under\ninstructions, protested against the wanton act and demanded satisfaction. The\nGovernment of Honduras, actuated by a sense of justice and in a spirit of the\nutmost friendship, promptly disavowed the illegal conduct of its officers and\nexpressed sincere regret for the occurrence.</p>\n\n<p>It is confidently anticipated that a satisfactory adjustment will soon be\nreached of the questions arising out of the seizure and use of American\nvessels by insurgents in Honduras and the subsequent denial by the successful\nGovernment of commercial privileges to those vessels on that account.</p>\n\n<p>A notable part of the southeasterly coast of Liberia between the Cavally and\nSan Pedro rivers, which for nearly half a century has been generally\nrecognized as belonging to that Republic by cession and purchase, has been\nclaimed to be under the protectorate of France in virtue of agreements entered\ninto by the native tribes, over whom Liberia\'s control has not been well\nmaintained.</p>\n\n<p>More recently negotiations between the Liberian representative and the French\nGovernment resulted in the signature at Paris of a treaty whereby as an\nadjustment certain Liberian territory is ceded to France. This convention at\nlast advices had not been ratified by the Liberian Legislature and Executive.</p>\n\n<p>Feeling a sympathetic interest in the fortunes of the little Commonwealth, the\nestablishment and development of which were largely aided by the benevolence\nof our countrymen, and which constitutes the only independently sovereign\nstate on the west coast of Africa, this Government has suggested to the French\nGovernment its earnest concern lest territorial impairment in Liberia should\ntake place without her unconstrained consent.</p>\n\n<p>Our relations with Mexico continue to be of that close and friendly nature\nwhich should always characterize the intercourse of two neighboring republics.</p>\n\n<p>The work of relocating the monuments marking the boundary between the two\ncountries from Paso del Norte to the Pacific is now nearly completed.</p>\n\n<p>The commission recently organized under the conventions of 1884 and 1889 it is\nexpected will speedily settle disputes growing out of the shifting currents of\nthe Rio Grande River east of E1 Paso.</p>\n\n<p>Nicaragua has recently passed through two revolutions, the party at first\nsuccessful having in turn been displaced by another. Our newly appointed\nminister by his timely good offices aided in a peaceful adjustment of the\ncontroversy involved in the first conflict. The large American interests\nestablished in that country in connection with the Nicaragua Canal were not\nmolested.</p>\n\n<p>The canal company has unfortunately become financially seriously embarrassed,\nbut a generous treatment had been extended to it by the Government of\nNicaragua. The United States are especially interested in the successful\nachievement of the vast undertaking this company has in charge. That it should\nbe accomplished under distinctively American auspices, and its enjoyment\nassured not only to the vessels of this country as a channel of communication\nbetween our Atlantic and Pacific sea-boards, but to the ships of the world in\nthe interests of civilization, is a proposition which, in my judgment, does\nnot admit of question.</p>\n\n<p>Guatemala has also been visited by the political vicissitudes which have\nafflicted her Central American neighbors, but the dissolution of its\nLegislature and the proclamation of a dictatorship have been unattended with\ncivil war.</p>\n\n<p>An extradition treaty with Norway has recently been exchanged and proclaimed.</p>\n\n<p>The extradition treaty with Russia signed in March, 1887, and amended and\nconfirmed by the Senate in February last, was duly proclaimed last June.</p>\n\n<p>Led by a desire to compose differences and contribute to the restoration of\norder in Samoa, which for some years previous had been the scene of\nconflicting foreign pretensions and native strife, the United States,\ndeparting from its policy consecrated by a century of observance, entered four\nyears ago into the treaty of Berlin, thereby becoming jointly bound with\nEngland and Germany to establish and maintain Malietoa Laupepa as King of\nSamoa. The treaty provided for a foreign court of justice; a municipal council\nfor the district of Apia, with a foreign president thereof, authorized to\nadvise the King; a tribunal for the settlement of native and foreign land\ntitles, and a revenue system for the Kingdom. It entailed upon the three\npowers that part of the cost of the new Government not met by the revenue of\nthe islands.</p>\n\n<p>Early in the life of this triple protectorate the native dissensions it was\ndesigned to quell revived. Rivals defied the authority of the new King,\nrefusing to pay taxes and demanding the election of a ruler by native\nsuffrage. Mataafa, an aspirant to the throne, and a large number of his native\nadherents were in open rebellion on one of the islands. Quite lately, at the\nrequest of the other powers and in fulfillment of its treaty obligation, this\nGovernment agreed to unite in a joint military movement of such dimensions as\nwould probably secure the surrender of the insurgents without bloodshed.</p>\n\n<p>The war ship Philadelphia was accordingly put under orders for Samoa, but\nbefore she arrived the threatened conflict was precipitated by King Malietoa\'s\nattack upon the insurgent camp. Mataafa was defeated and a number of his men\nkilled. The British and German naval vessels present subsequently secured the\nsurrender of Mataafa and his adherents. The defeated chief and ten of his\nprincipal supporters were deported to a German island of the Marshall group,\nwhere they are held as prisoners under the joint responsibility and cost of\nthe three powers.</p>\n\n<p>This incident and the events leading up to it signally illustrate the impolicy\nof entangling alliances with foreign powers.</p>\n\n<p>More than fifteen years ago this Government preferred a claim against Spain in\nbehalf of one of our citizens for property seized and confiscated in Cuba. In\n1886 the claim was adjusted, Spain agreeing to pay unconditionally, as a fair\nindemnity, $1,500,000. A respectful but earnest note was recently addressed to\nthe Spanish Government insisting upon prompt fulfillment of its long-neglected\nobligation.</p>\n\n<p>Other claims preferred by the United States against Spain in behalf of\nAmerican citizens for property confiscated in Cuba have been pending for many\nyears.</p>\n\n<p>At the time Spain\'s title to the Caroline Islands was confirmed by arbitration\nthat Government agreed that the rights which had been acquired there by\nAmerican missionaries should be recognized and respected. It is sincerely\nhoped that this pledge will be observed by allowing our missionaries, who were\nremoved from Ponape to a place of safety by a United States war ship during\nthe late troubles between the Spanish garrison and the natives, to return to\ntheir field of usefulness.</p>\n\n<p>The reproduced caravel Santa Maria, built by Spain and sent to the Columbian\nExposition, has been presented to the United States in token of amity and in\ncommemoration of the event it was designed to celebrate. I recommend that in\naccepting this gift Congress make grateful recognition of the sincere\nfriendship which prompted it.</p>\n\n<p>Important matters have demanded attention in our relations with the Ottoman\nPorte.</p>\n\n<p>The firing and partial destruction by an unrestrained mob of one of the school\nbuildings of Anatolia College, established by citizens of the United States at\nMarsovan, and the apparent indifference of the Turkish Government to the\noutrage, notwithstanding the complicity of some of its officials, called for\nearnest remonstrance, which was followed by promise of reparation and\npunishment of the offenders.</p>\n\n<p>Indemnity for the injury to the buildings has already been paid, permission to\nrebuild given, registration of the school property in the name of the American\nowners secured, and efficient protection guaranteed.</p>\n\n<p>Information received of maltreatment suffered by an inoffensive American woman\nengaged in missionary work in Turkish Koordistan was followed by such\nrepresentations to the Porte as resulted in the issuance of orders for the\npunishment of her assailants, the removal of a delinquent official, and the\nadoption of measures for the protection of our citizens engaged in mission and\nother lawful work in that quarter.</p>\n\n<p>Turkey complains that her Armenian subjects obtain citizenship in this country\nnot to identify themselves in good faith with our people, but with the\nintention of returning to the land of their birth and there engaging in\nsedition. This complaint is not wholly without foundation. A journal published\nin this country in the Armenian language openly counsels its readers to arm,\norganize, and participate in movements for the subversion of Turkish authority\nin the Asiatic provinces. The Ottoman Government has announced its intention\nto expel from its dominions Armenians who have obtained naturalization in the\nUnited States since 1868.</p>\n\n<p>The right to exclude any or all classes of aliens is an attribute of\nsovereignty. It is a right asserted and, to a limited extent, enforced by the\nUnited States, with the sanction of our highest court. There being no\nnaturalization treaty between the United States and Turkey, our minister at\nConstantinople has been instructed that, while recognizing the right of that\nGovernment to enforce its declared policy against naturalized Armenians, he is\nexpected to protect them from unnecessary harshness of treatment.</p>\n\n<p>In view of the impaired financial resources of Venezuela consequent upon the\nrecent revolution there, a modified arrangement for the satisfaction of the\nawards of the late revisory claims commission, in progressive installments,\nhas been assented to, and payments are being regularly made thereunder.</p>\n\n<p>The boundary dispute between Venezuela and British Guiana is yet unadjusted. A\nrestoration of diplomatic intercourse between that Republic and Great Britain\nand reference of the question to impartial arbitration would be a most\ngratifying consummation.</p>\n\n<p>The ratification by Venezuela of the convention for the arbitration of the\nlong-deferred claim of the Venezuelan Transportation Company is awaited.</p>\n\n<p>It is hardly necessary for me to state that the questions arising from our\nrelations with Hawaii have caused serious embarrassment. Just prior to the\ninstallation of the present Administration the existing Government of Hawaii\nhad been suddenly overthrown and a treaty of annexation had been negotiated\nbetween the Provisional Government of the islands and the United States and\nsubmitted to the Senate for ratification. This treaty I withdrew for\nexamination and dispatched Hon. James H. Blount, of Georgia, to Honolulu as a\nspecial commissioner to make an impartial investigation of the circumstances\nattending the change of government and of all the conditions bearing upon the\nsubject of the treaty. After a thorough and exhaustive examination Mr. Blount\nsubmitted to me his report, showing beyond all question that the\nconstitutional Government of Hawaii had been subverted with the active aid of\nour representative to that Government and through the intimidation caused by\nthe presence of an armed naval force of the United States, which was landed\nfor that purpose at the instance of our minister. Upon the facts developed it\nseemed to me the only honorable course for our Government to pursue was to\nundo the wrong that had been done by those representing us and to restore as\nfar as practicable the status existing at the time of our forcible\nintervention. With a view of accomplishing this result within the\nconstitutional limits of executive power, and recognizing all our obligations\nand responsibilities growing out of any changed conditions brought about by\nour unjustifiable interference, our present minister at Honolulu has received\nappropriate instructions to that end. Thus far no information of the\naccomplishment of any definite results has been received from him.</p>\n\n<p>Additional advices are soon expected. When received they will be promptly sent\nto the Congress, together with all other information at hand, accompanied by a\nspecial Executive message fully detailing all the facts necessary to a\ncomplete understanding of the case and presenting a history of all the\nmaterial events leading up to the present situation.</p>\n\n<p>By a concurrent resolution passed by the Senate February 14, 1890, and by the\nHouse of Representatives on the 3d of April following the President was\nrequested to "invite from time to time, as fit occasions may arise,\nnegotiations with any government with which the United States has or may have\ndiplomatic relations, to the end that any differences or disputes arising\nbetween the two governments which can not be adjusted by diplomatic agency may\nbe referred to arbitration and be peaceably adjusted by such means." April 18,\n1890, the International American Conference of Washington by resolution\nexpressed the wish that all controversies between the republics of America and\nthe nations of Europe might be settled by arbitration, and recommended that\nthe government of each nation represented in that conference should\ncommunicate this wish to all friendly powers. A favorable response has been\nreceived from Great Britain in the shape of a resolution adopted by Parliament\nJuly 16 last, cordially sympathizing with the purpose in view and expressing\nthe hope that Her Majesty\'s Government will lend ready cooperation to the\nGovernment of the United States upon the basis of the concurrent resolution\nabove quoted.</p>\n\n<p>It affords me signal pleasure to lay this parliamentary resolution before the\nCongress and to express my sincere gratification that the sentiment of two\ngreat and kindred nations is thus authoritatively manifested in favor of the\nrational and peaceable settlement of international quarrels by honorable\nresort to arbitration.</p>\n\n<p>Since the-passage of the act of March 3, 1893, authorizing the President to\nraise the grade of our envoys to correspond with the rank in which foreign\ncountries accredit their agents here, Great Britain, France, Italy, and\nGermany have conferred upon their representatives at this capital the title of\nambassador, and I have responded by accrediting the agents of the United\nStates in those countries with the same title. A like elevation of mission is\nannounced by Russia, and when made will be similarly met. This step fittingly\ncomports with the position the United States hold in the family of nations.</p>\n\n<p>During my former Administration I took occasion to recommend a recast of the\nlaws relating to the consular service, in order that it might become a more\nefficient agency in the promotion of the interests it was intended to\nsubserve. The duties and powers of consuls have been expanded with the growing\nrequirements of our foreign trade. Discharging important duties affecting our\ncommerce and American citizens abroad, and in certain countries exercising\njudicial functions, these officers should be men of character, intelligence,\nand ability.</p>\n\n<p>Upon proof that the legislation of Denmark secures copyright to American\ncitizens on equal footing with its own, the privileges of our copyright laws\nhave been extended by proclamation to subjects of that country.</p>\n\n<p>The Secretary of the Treasury reports that the receipts of the Government from\nall sources during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1893, amounted to\n$461,716,561.94 and its expenditures to $459,374,674.29. There was collected\nfrom customs $205,355,016.73 and from internal revenue $161,027,623.93. Our\ndutiable imports amounted to $421,856,711, an increase of $52,453,907 over the\npreceding year, and importations free of duty amounted to $444,544,211, a\ndecrease from the preceding year of $13,455,447. Internal-revenue receipts\nexceeded those of the preceding year by $7,147,445.32. The total tax collected\non distilled spirits was $94,720,260.55, on manufactured tobacco\n$31,889,711.74, and on fermented liquors $32,548,983.07. We exported\nmerchandise during the year amounting to $847,665,194, a decrease of\n$182,612,954 from the preceding year. The amount of gold exported was larger\nthan any previous year in the history of the Government, amounting to\n$108,680,844, and exceeding the amount exported during the preceding year\nby$58,485,517.</p>\n\n<p>The sum paid from the Treasury for sugar bounty was $9,375,130.88, an increase\nover the preceding year of $2,033,053.09.</p>\n\n<p>It is estimated upon the basis of present revenue laws that the receipts of\nthe Government for the year ending June 30, 1894, will be $430,121,365.38 and\nits expenditures $458,121,365.28, resulting in a deficiency of $28,000,000.</p>\n\n<p>On the 1st day of November, 1893, the amount of money of all kinds in\ncirculation, or not included in Treasury holdings, was $1,718,544,682, an\nincrease for the year of $112,404,947. Estimating our population at 67,426,000\nat the time mentioned, the per capita circulation was $25.49. On the same date\nthere was in the Treasury gold bullion amounting to $96,657,273 and silver\nbullion which was purchased at a cost of $126,261,553.</p>\n\n<p>The purchases of silver under the law of July 14, 1890, during the last fiscal\nyear aggregated 54,008,162.59 fine ounces, which cost $45,531,374.53. The\ntotal amount of silver purchased from the time that law became operative until\nthe repeal of its purchasing clause, on the 1st day of November, 1893, was\n168,674,590.46 fine ounces, which cost $155,930,940.84. Between the 1st day of\nMarch, 1873, and the 1st day of November, 1893, the Government purchased under\nall laws 503,003,717 fine ounces of silver, at a cost of $516,622,948. The\nsilver dollars that have been coined under the act of July 14, 1890, number\n36,087,285. The seigniorage arising from such coinage was $6,977,098.39,\nleaving on hand in the mints 140,699,760 fine ounces of silver, which cost\n$126,758,218.</p>\n\n<p>Our total coinage of all metals during the last fiscal year consisted of\n97,280,875 pieces, valued at $43,685,178.80, of which there was $30,038,140 in\ngold coin, $5,343,715 in silver dollars, $7,217,220.90 in subsidiary silver\ncoin, and $1,086,102.90 in minor coins.</p>\n\n<p>During the calendar year 1892 the production of precious metals in the United\nStates was estimated to be 1,596,375 fine ounces of gold of the commercial and\ncoinage value of $33,000,000 and 58,000,000 fine ounces of silver of the\nbullion or market value of $50,750,000 and of the coinage value of\n$74,989,900.</p>\n\n<p>It is estimated that on the 1st day of July, 1893, the metallic stock of money\nin the United States, consisting of coin and bullion, amounted to\n$1,213,559,169, of which $597,697,685 was gold and $615,861,484 was silver.</p>\n\n<p>One hundred and nineteen national banks were organized during the year ending\nOctober 31, 1893, with a capital of $11,230,000. Forty-six went into voluntary\nliquidation and 158 suspended. Sixty-five of the suspended banks were\ninsolvent, 86 resumed business, and 7 remain in the hands of the bank\nexaminers, with prospects of speedy resumption. Of the new banks organized, 44\nwere located in the Eastern States, 41 west of the Mississippi River, and 34\nin the Central and Southern States. The total number of national banks in\nexistence on October 31, 1893, was 3,796, having an aggregate capital of\n$695,558,120. The net increase in the circulation of these banks during the\nyear was $36,886,972.</p>\n\n<p>The recent repeal of the provision of law requiring the purchase of silver\nbullion by the Government as a feature of our monetary scheme has made an\nentire change in the complexion of our currency affairs. I do not doubt that\nthe ultimate result of this action will be most salutary and far-reaching. In\nthe nature of things, however, it is impossible to know at this time precisely\nwhat conditions will be brought about by the change, or what, if any,\nsupplementary legislation may in the light of such conditions appear to be\nessential or expedient. Of course, after the recent financial perturbation,\ntime is necessary for the reestablishment of business confidence. When,\nhowever, through this restored confidence, the money which has been frightened\ninto hoarding places is returned to trade and enterprise, a survey of the\nsituation will probably disclose a safe path leading to a permanently sound\ncurrency, abundantly sufficient to meet every requirement of our increasing\npopulation and business.</p>\n\n<p>In the pursuit of this object we should resolutely turn away from alluring and\ntemporary expedients, determined to be content with nothing less than a\nlasting and comprehensive financial plan. In these circumstances I am\nconvinced that a reasonable delay in dealing with this subject, instead of\nbeing injurious, will increase the probability of wise action.</p>\n\n<p>The monetary conference which assembled at Brussels upon our invitation was\nadjourned to the 30th day of November of the present year. The considerations\njust stated and the fact that a definite proposition from us seemed to be\nexpected upon the reassembling of the conference led me to express a\nwillingness to have the meeting still further postponed.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that it would be wise to give general authority to the\nPresident to invite other nations to such a conference at any time when there\nshould be a fair prospect of accomplishing an international agreement on the\nsubject of coinage.</p>\n\n<p>I desire also to earnestly suggest the wisdom of amending the existing\nstatutes in regard to the issuance of Government bonds. The authority now\nvested in the Secretary of the Treasury to issue bonds is not as clear as it\nshould be, and the bonds authorized are disadvantageous to the Government both\nas to the time of their maturity and rate of interest.</p>\n\n<p>The Superintendent of Immigration, through the Secretary of the Treasury,\nreports that during the last fiscal year there arrived at our ports 440,793\nimmigrants. Of these, 1,063 were not permitted to land under the limitations\nof the law and 577 were returned to the countries from whence they came by\nreason of their having become public charges. The total arrivals were 141,034\nless than for the previous year.</p>\n\n<p>The Secretary in his report gives an account of the operation of the\nMarine-Hospital Service and of the good work done under its supervision in\npreventing the entrance and spread of contagious diseases.</p>\n\n<p>The admonitions of the last two years touching our public health and the\ndemonstrated danger of the introduction of contagious diseases from foreign\nports have invested the subject of national quarantine with increased\ninterest. A more general and harmonious system than now exists, acting\npromptly and directly everywhere and constantly operating by preventive means\nto shield our country from the invasion of disease, and at the same time\nhaving due regard to the rights and duties of local agencies, would, I\nbelieve, add greatly to the safety of our people.</p>\n\n<p>The Secretary of War reports that the strength of the Army on the 30th day of\nSeptember last was 25,778 enlisted men and 2,144 officers.</p>\n\n<p>The total expenditures of the Department for the year ending June 30, 1893,\namounted to $51,966,074.89. Of this sum $1,992,581.95 was for salaries and\ncontingent expenses, $23,377,828.35 for the support of the military\nestablishment, $6,077,033.18 for miscellaneous objects, and 518,631.41 for\npublic works. This latter sum includes $15,296,876.46 for river and harbor\nimprovements and $3,266,141.20 for fortifications and other works of defense.</p>\n\n<p>The total enrollment of the militia of the several States was on the 31st of\nOctober of the current year 112,597 officers and enlisted men. The officers of\nthe Army detailed for the inspection and instruction of this reserve of our\nmilitary force report that increased interest and marked progress are apparent\nin the discipline and efficiency of the organization.</p>\n\n<p>Neither Indian outbreaks nor domestic violence have called the Army into\nservice during the year, and the only active military duty required of it has\nbeen in the Department of Texas, where violations of the neutrality laws of\nthe United States and Mexico were promptly and efficiently dealt with by the\ntroops, eliciting the warm approval of the civil and military authorities of\nboth countries.</p>\n\n<p>The operation of wise laws and the influences of civilization constantly\ntending to relieve the country from the dangers of Indian hostilities,\ntogether with the increasing ability of the States, through the efficiency of\nthe National Guard organizations, to protect their citizens from domestic\nviolence, lead to the suggestion that the time is fast approaching when there\nshould be a reorganization of our Army on the lines of the present necessities\nof the country. This change contemplates neither increase in number nor added\nexpense, but a redistribution of the force and an encouragement of measures\ntending to greater efficiency among the men and improvement of the service.</p>\n\n<p>The adoption of battalion formations for infantry regiments, the strengthening\nof the artillery force, the abandonment of smaller and unnecessary posts, and\nthe massing of the troops at important and accessible stations all promise to\npromote the usefulness of the Army. In the judgment of army officers, with but\nfew exceptions, the operation of the law forbidding the reenlistment of men\nafter ten years\' service has not proved its wisdom, and while the arguments\nthat led to its adoption were not without merit the experience of the year\nconstrains me to join in the recommendation for its repeal.</p>\n\n<p>It is gratifying to note that we have begun to attain completed results in the\ncomprehensive scheme of seacoast defense and fortification entered upon eight\nyears ago. A large sum has been already expended, but the cost of maintenance\nwill be inconsiderable as compared with the expense of construction and\nordnance. At the end of the current calendar year the War Department will have\nnine 12-inch guns, twenty 10-inch, and thirty-four 8-inch guns ready to be\nmounted on gun lifts and carriages, and seventy-five 12-inch mortars. In\naddition to the product of the Army Gun Factory, now completed at Watervliet,\nthe Government has contracted with private parties for the purchase of one\nhundred guns of these calibers, the first of which should be delivered to the\nDepartment for test before July 1, 1894.</p>\n\n<p>The manufacture of heavy ordnance keeps pace with current needs, but to render\nthese guns available for the purposes they are designed to meet emplacements\nmust be prepared for them. Progress has been made in this direction, and it is\ndesirable that Congress by adequate appropriations should provide for the\nuninterrupted prosecution of this necessary work.</p>\n\n<p>After much preliminary work and exhaustive examination in accordance with the\nrequirements of the law, the board appointed to select a magazine rifle of\nmodern type with which to replace the obsolete Springfield rifle of the\ninfantry service completed its labors during the last year, and the work of\nmanufacture is now in progress at the national armory at Springfield. It is\nconfidently expected that by the end of the current year our infantry will be\nsupplied with a weapon equal to that of the most progressive armies of the\nworld.</p>\n\n<p>The work on the projected Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park\nhas been prosecuted with zeal and judgment, and its opening will be celebrated\nduring the coming year. Over 9 square miles of the Chickamauga battlefield\nhave been acquired, 25 miles of roadway have been constructed, and permanent\ntablets have been placed at many historical points, while the invitation to\nthe States to mark the positions of their troops participating in the battle\nhas been very generally accepted.</p>\n\n<p>The work of locating and preserving the lines of battle at the Gettysburg\nbattlefield is making satisfactory progress on the plans directed by the last\nCongress.</p>\n\n<p>The reports of the Military Academy at West Point and the several schools for\nspecial instruction of officers show marked advance in the education of the\nArmy and a commendable ambition among its officers to excel in the military\nprofession and to fit themselves for the highest service to the country.</p>\n\n<p>Under the supervision of Adjutant-General Robert Williams, lately retired, the\nBureau of Military Information has become well established and is performing a\nservice that will put in possession of the Government in time of war most\nvaluable information, and at all times serve a purpose of great utility in\nkeeping the Army advised of the world\'s progress in all matters pertaining to\nthe art of war.</p>\n\n<p>The report of the Attorney-General contains the usual summary of the affairs\nand proceedings of the Department of Justice for the past year, together with\ncertain recommendations as to needed legislation on various subjects. I can\nnot too heartily indorse the proposition that the fee system as applicable to\nthe compensation of United States attorneys, marshals, clerks of Federal\ncourts, and United States commissioners should be abolished with as little\ndelay as possible. It is clearly in the interest of the community that the\nbusiness of the courts, both civil and criminal, shall be as small and as\ninexpensively transacted as the ends of justice will allow.</p>\n\n<p>The system is therefore thoroughly vicious which makes the compensation of\ncourt officials depend upon the volume of such business, and thus creates a\nconflict between a proper execution of the law and private gain, which can not\nfail to be dangerous to the rights and freedom of the citizen and an\nirresistible temptation to the unjustifiable expenditure of public funds. If\nin addition to this reform another was inaugurated which would give to United\nStates commissioners the final disposition of petty offenses within the grade\nof misdemeanors, especially those coming under the internal-revenue laws, a\ngreat advance would be made toward a more decent administration of the\ncriminal law.</p>\n\n<p>In my first message to Congress, dated December 8, 1885, I strongly\nrecommended these changes and referred somewhat at length to the evils of the\npresent system. Since that time the criminal business of the Federal courts\nand the expense attending it have enormously increased. The number of criminal\nprosecutions pending in the circuit and district courts of the United States\non the 1st day of July, 1885, was 3,808, of which 1,884 were for violations of\nthe internal-revenue laws, while the number of such prosecutions pending on\nthe 1st day of July, 1893, was 9,500, of which 4,200 were for violations of\nthe internal-revenue laws. The expense of the United States courts, exclusive\nof judges\' salaries, for the year ending July 1, 1885, was $2,874,733.11 and\nfor the year ending July 1, 1893, $4,528,676.87.</p>\n\n<p>It is therefore apparent that the reasons given in 1885 for a change in the\nmanner of enforcing the Federal criminal law have gained cogency and strength\nby lapse of time.</p>\n\n<p>I also heartily join the Attorney-General in recommending legislation fixing\ndegrees of the crime of murder within Federal jurisdiction, as has been done\nin many of the States; authorizing writs of error on behalf of the Government\nin cases where final judgment is rendered against the sufficiency of an\nindictment or against the Government upon any other question arising before\nactual trial; limiting the right of review in cases of felony punishable only\nby fine and imprisonment to the circuit court of appeals, and making speedy\nprovision for the construction of such prisons and reformatories as may be\nnecessary for the confinement of United States convicts.</p>\n\n<p>The report of the Postmaster-General contains a detailed statement of the\noperations of the Post-Office Department during the last fiscal year and much\ninteresting information touching this important branch of the public service.</p>\n\n<p>The business of the mails indicates with absolute certainty the condition of\nthe business of the country, and depression in financial affairs inevitably\nand quickly reduces the postal revenues. Therefore a larger discrepancy than\nusual between the post-office receipts and expenditures is the expected and\nunavoidable result of the distressing stringency which has prevailed\nthroughout the country during much of the time covered by the\nPostmaster-General\'s report. At a date when better times were anticipated it\nwas estimated by his predecessor that the deficiency on the 30th day of June,\n1893, would be but a little over a million and a half dollars. It amounted,\nhowever, to more than five millions. At the same time and under the influence\nof like anticipations estimates were made for the current fiscal year, ending\nJune 30, 1894, which exhibited a surplus of revenue over expenditures of\n$872,245.71; but now, in view of the actual receipts and expenditures during\nthat part of the current fiscal year already expired, the present\nPostmaster-General estimates that at its close instead of a surplus there will\nbe a deficiency of nearly $8,000,000.</p>\n\n<p>The post-office receipts for the last fiscal year amounted to $75,896,933.16\nand its expenditures to $81,074,104.90. This post-office deficiency would\ndisappear or be immensely decreased if less matter were carried free through\nthe mails, an item of which is upward of 300 tons of seeds and grain from the\nAgricultural Department.</p>\n\n<p>The total number of post-offices in the United States on the 30th day of June,\n1893, was 68,403, an increase of 1,284 over the preceding year. Of these,\n3,360 were Presidential, an increase in that class of 204 over the preceding\nyear.</p>\n\n<p>Forty-two free-delivery offices were added during the year to those already\nexisting, making a total of 610 cities and towns provided with free delivery\non June 30, 1893. Ninety-three other cities and towns are now entitled to this\nservice under the law, but it has not been accorded them on account of\ninsufficient funds to meet the expenses of its establishment.</p>\n\n<p>I am decidedly of the opinion that the provisions of the present law permit as\ngeneral an introduction of this feature of mail service as is necessary or\njustifiable, and that it ought not to be extended to smaller communities than\nare now designated.</p>\n\n<p>The expenses of free delivery for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, will\nbe more than $11,000,000, and under legislation now existing there must be a\nconstant increase in this item of expenditure.</p>\n\n<p>There were 6,401 additions to the domestic money-order offices during the last\nfiscal year, being the largest increase in any year since the inauguration of\nthe system. The total number of these offices at the close of the year was\n18,434. There were 13,309,735 money orders issued from these offices, being an\nincrease over the preceding year of 1,240,293, and the value of these orders\namounted to $127,576,433.65, an increase of $7,509,632.58. There were also\nissued during the year postal notes amounting to $12,903,076.73.</p>\n\n<p>During the year 195 international money-order offices were added to those\nalready provided, making a total of 2,407 in operation on June 30, 1893. The\nnumber of international money orders issued during the year was 1,055,999, an\nincrease over the preceding year of 72,525, and their value was\n$16,341,837.86, an increase of $2,221,506.31. The number of orders paid was\n300,917, an increase over the preceding year of 13,503, and their value was\n$5,283,375.70, an increase of $94,094.83.</p>\n\n<p>From the foregoing statements it appears that the total issue of money orders\nand postal notes for the year amounted to $156,822,348.24.</p>\n\n<p>The number of letters and packages mailed during the year for special delivery\nwas 3,375,693, an increase over the preceding year of nearly 22 per cent. The\nspecial-delivery stamps used upon these letters and packages amounted to\n$337,569.30, and the messengers\' fees paid for their delivery amounted to\n$256,592.71, leaving a profit to the Government of $80,976.59.</p>\n\n<p>The Railway Mail Service not only adds to the promptness of mail delivery at\nall offices, but it is the especial instrumentality which puts the smaller and\nway places in the service on an equality in that regard with the larger and\nterminal offices. This branch of the postal service has therefore received\nmuch attention from the Postmaster-General, and though it is gratifying to\nknow that it is in a condition of high efficiency and great usefulness, I am\nled to agree with the Postmaster-General that there is room for its further\nimprovement.</p>\n\n<p>There are now connected to the Post-Office establishment 28,324 employees who\nare in the classified service. The head of this great Department gives\nconclusive evidence of the value of civil-service reform when, after an\nexperience that renders his judgment on the subject absolutely reliable, he\nexpresses the opinion that without the benefit of this system it would be\nimpossible to conduct the vast business intrusted to him.</p>\n\n<p>I desire to commend as especially worthy of prompt attention the suggestions\nof the Postmaster-General relating to a more sensible and business like\norganization and a better distribution of responsibility in his Department.</p>\n\n<p>The report of the Secretary of the Navy contains a history of the operations\nof his Department during the past year and exhibits a most gratifying\ncondition of the personnel of our Navy. He presents a satisfactory account of\nthe progress which has been made in the construction of vessels and makes a\nnumber of recommendations to which attention is especially invited.</p>\n\n<p>During the past six months the demands for cruising vessels have been many and\nurgent. There have been revolutions calling for vessels to protect American\ninterests in Nicaragua, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Honduras, Argentina, and\nBrazil, while the condition of affairs in Honolulu has required the constant\npresence of one or more ships. With all these calls upon our Navy it became\nnecessary, in order to make up a sufficient fleet to patrol the Bering Sea\nunder the modus vivendi agreed upon with Great Britain, to detail to that\nservice one vessel from the Fish Commission and three from the Revenue Marine.</p>\n\n<p>Progress in the construction of new vessels has not been as rapid as was\nanticipated. There have been delays in the completion of unarmored vessels,\nbut for the most part they have been such as are constantly occurring even in\ncountries having the largest experience in naval shipbuilding. The most\nserious delays, however, have been in the work upon armored ships. The trouble\nhas been the failure of contractors to deliver armor as agreed. The\ndifficulties seem now, however, to have been all overcome, and armor is being\ndelivered with satisfactory promptness. As a result of the experience acquired\nby shipbuilders and designers and material men, it is believed that the dates\nwhen vessels will be completed can now be estimated with reasonable accuracy.\nGreat guns, rapid-fire guns, torpedoes, and powder are being promptly\nsupplied.</p>\n\n<p>The following vessels of the new Navy have been completed and are now ready\nfor service: The double-turreted coast-defense monitor Miantonomoh, the\ndouble-turreted coast-defense monitor Monterey, the armored cruiser New York,\nthe protected cruisers Baltimore, Chicago, Philadelphia, Newark, San\nFrancisco, Charleston, Atlanta, and Boston, the cruiser Detroit, the gunboats\nYorktown, Concord, Bennington, Machias, Castine, and Petrel, the dispatch\nvessel Dolphin, the practice vessel Bancroft, and the dynamite gunboat\nVesuvius. Of these the Bancroft, Machias, Detroit, and Castine have been\nplaced in commission during the current calendar year.</p>\n\n<p>The following vessels are in process of construction: The second-class battle\nships Maine and Texas, the cruisers Montgomery and Marblehead, and the\ncoast-defense monitors Terror, Puritan, Amphitrite, and Monadnock, all of\nwhich will be completed within one year; the harbor-defense ram Katahdin and\nthe protected cruisers Columbia, Minneapolis, Olympia, Cincinnati, and\nRaleigh, all of which will be completed prior to July 1, 1895; the first-class\nbattle ships Iowa, Indiana, Massachusetts, and Oregon, which will be completed\nFebruary 1, 1896, and the armored cruiser Brooklyn, which will be completed by\nAugust 1 of that year. It is also expected that the three gunboats authorized\nby the last Congress will be completed in less than two years.</p>\n\n<p>Since 1886 Congress has at each session authorized the building of one or more\nvessels, and the Secretary of the Navy presents an earnest plea for the\ncontinuance of this plan. He recommends the authorization of at least one\nbattle ship and six torpedo boats.</p>\n\n<p>While I am distinctly in favor of consistently pursuing the policy we have\ninaugurated of building up a thorough and efficient Navy, I can not refrain\nfrom the suggestion that the Congress should carefully take into account the\nnumber of unfinished vessels on our hands and the depleted condition of our\nTreasury in considering the propriety of an appropriation at this time to\nbegin new work.</p>\n\n<p>The method of employing mechanical labor at navy-yards through boards of labor\nand making efficiency the sole test by which laborers are employed and\ncontinued is producing the best results, and the Secretary is earnestly\ndevoting himself to its development. Attention is invited to the statements of\nhis report in regard to the workings of the system.</p>\n\n<p>The Secretary of the Interior has the supervision of so many important\nsubjects that his report is of especial value and interest.</p>\n\n<p>On the 30th day of June, 1893, there were on the pension rolls 966,012 names,\nan increase of 89,944 over the number on the rolls June 30, 1892. Of these\nthere were 17 widows and daughters of Revolutionary soldiers, 86 survivors of\nthe War of 1812, 5,425 widows of soldiers of that war, 21,518 survivors and\nwidows of the Mexican War, 3,882 survivors and widows of Indian wars, 284 army\nnurses. and 475,645 survivors and widows and children of deceased soldiers and\nsailors of the War of the Rebellion. The latter number represents those\npensioned on account of disabilities or death resulting from army and navy\nservice. The number of persons remaining on the rolls June 30, 1893, who were\npensioned under the act of June 27, 1890, which allows pensions on account of\ndeath and disability not chargeable to army service, was 459,155.</p>\n\n<p>The number added to the rolls during the year was 123,634 and the number\ndropped was 33,690. The first payments on pensions allowed during the year\namounted to $33,756,549.98. This includes arrears, or the accumulation between\nthe time from which the allowance of pension dates and the time of actually\ngranting the certificate.</p>\n\n<p>Although the law of 1890 permits pensions for disabilities not related to\nmilitary service, yet as a requisite to its benefits a disability must exist\nincapacitating applicants "from the performance of manual labor to such a\ndegree as to render them unable to earn a support." The execution of this law\nin its early stages does not seem to have been in accord with its true\nintention, but toward the close of the last Administration an authoritative\nconstruction was given to the statute, and since that time this construction\nhas been followed. This has had the effect of limiting the operation of the\nlaw to its intended purpose. The discovery having been made that many names\nhad been put upon the pension roll by means of wholesale and gigantic frauds,\nthe Commissioner suspended payments upon a number of pensions which seemed to\nbe fraudulent or unauthorized pending a complete examination, giving notice to\nthe pensioners, in order that they might have an opportunity to establish, if\npossible, the justice of their claims notwithstanding apparent invalidity.</p>\n\n<p>This, I understand, is the practice which has for a long time prevailed in the\nPension Bureau; but after entering upon these recent investigations the\nCommissioner modified this rule so as not to allow until after a complete\nexamination interference with the payment of a pension apparently not\naltogether void, but which merely had been fixed at a rate higher than that\nauthorized by law.</p>\n\n<p>I am unable to understand why frauds in the pension rolls should not be\nexposed and corrected with thoroughness and vigor. Every name fraudulently put\nupon these rolls is a wicked imposition upon the kindly sentiment in which\npensions have their origin; every fraudulent pensioner has become a bad\ncitizen; every false oath in support of a pension has made perjury more\ncommon, and false and undeserving pensioners rob the people not only of their\nmoney, but of the patriotic sentiment which the survivors of a war fought for\nthe preservation of the Union ought to inspire. Thousands of neighborhoods\nhave their well-known fraudulent pensioners, and recent developments by the\nBureau establish appalling conspiracies to accomplish pension frauds. By no\nmeans the least wrong done is to brave and deserving pensioners, who certainly\nought not to be condemned to such association.</p>\n\n<p>Those who attempt in the line of duty to rectify these wrongs should not be\naccused of enmity or indifference to the claims of honest veterans. The sum\nexpended on account of pensions for the year ending June 30, 1893, was\n$156,740,467.14.</p>\n\n<p>The Commissioner estimates that $165,000,000 will be required to pay pensions\nduring the year ending June 30, 1894.</p>\n\n<p>The condition of the Indians and their ultimate fate are subjects which are\nrelated to a sacred duty of the Government and which strongly appeal to the\nsense of justice and the sympathy of our people.</p>\n\n<p>Our Indians number about 248,000. Most of them are located on 161\nreservations, containing 86,116,531 acres of land. About 110,000 of these\nIndians have to a large degree adopted civilized customs. Lands in severalty\nhave been allotted to many of them. Such allotments have been made to 10,000\nindividuals during the last fiscal year, embracing about 1,000,000 acres. The\nnumber of Indian Government schools opened during the year was 195, an\nincrease of 12 over the preceding year. Of this total 170 were on\nreservations, of which 73 were boarding schools and 97 were day schools.\nTwenty boarding schools and 5 day schools supported by the Government were not\nlocated on reservations. The total number of Indian children enrolled during\nthe year as attendants of all schools was 21,138, an increase of 1,231 over\nthe enrollment for the previous year.</p>\n\n<p>I am sure that secular education and moral and religious teaching must be\nimportant factors in any effort to save the Indian and lead him to\ncivilization. I believe, too, that the relinquishment of tribal relations and\nthe holding of land in severalty may in favorable conditions aid this\nconsummation. It seems to me, however, that allotments of land in severalty\nought to be made with great care and circumspection. If hastily done, before\nthe Indian knows its meaning, while yet he has little or no idea of tilling a\nfarm and no conception of thrift, there is great danger that a reservation\nlife in tribal relations may be exchanged for the pauperism of civilization\ninstead of its independence and elevation.</p>\n\n<p>The solution of the Indian problem depends very largely upon good\nadministration. The personal fitness of agents and their adaptability to the\npeculiar duty of caring for their wards are of the utmost importance.</p>\n\n<p>The law providing that, except in special cases, army officers shall be\ndetailed as Indian agents it is hoped will prove a successful experiment.</p>\n\n<p>There is danger of great abuses creeping into the prosecution of claims for\nIndian depredations, and I recommend that every possible safeguard be provided\nagainst the enforcement of unjust and fictitious claims of this description.</p>\n\n<p>The appropriations on account of the Indian Bureau for the year ending June\n30, 1894, amount to $7,954,962.99, a decrease as compared with the year\npreceding it of $387,131.95.</p>\n\n<p>The vast area of land which but a short time ago constituted the public domain\nis rapidly falling into private hands. It is certain that in the transfer the\nbeneficent intention of the Government to supply from its domain homes to the\nindustrious and worthy home seekers is often frustrated. Though the\nspeculator, who stands with extortionate purpose between the land office and\nthose who, with their families, are invited by the Government to settle on the\npublic lands, is a despicable character who ought not to be tolerated, yet it\nis difficult to thwart his schemes. The recent opening to settlement of the\nlands in the Cherokee Outlet, embracing an area of 6,500,000 acres,\nnotwithstanding the utmost care in framing the regulations governing the\nselection of locations and notwithstanding the presence of United States\ntroops, furnished an exhibition, though perhaps in a modified degree, of the\nmad scramble, the violence, and the fraudulent occupation which have\naccompanied previous openings of public land.</p>\n\n<p>I concur with the Secretary in the belief that these outrageous incidents can\nnot be entirely prevented without a change in the laws on the subject, and I\nhope his recommendations in that direction will be favorably considered.</p>\n\n<p>I especially commend to the attention of the Congress the statements contained\nin the Secretary\'s report concerning forestry. The time has come when\nefficient measures should be taken for the preservation of our forests from\nindiscriminate and remediless destruction.</p>\n\n<p>The report of the Secretary of Agriculture will be found exceedingly\ninteresting, especially to that large part of our citizens intimately\nconcerned in agricultural occupations.</p>\n\n<p>On the 7th day of March, 1893, there were upon its pay rolls 2,430 employees.\nThis number has been reduced to 1,850 persons. In view of a depleted public\nTreasury and the imperative demand of the people for economy in the\nadministration of their Government, the Secretary has entered upon the task of\nrationally reducing expenditures by the elimination from the pay rolls of all\npersons not needed for an efficient conduct of the affairs of the Department.</p>\n\n<p>During the first quarter of the present year the expenses of the Department\naggregated $345,876.76, as against $402,012.42 for the corresponding period of\nthe fiscal year ending June 30, 1893. The Secretary makes apparent his\nintention to continue this rate of reduction by submitting estimates for the\nnext fiscal year less by $994,280 than those for the present year.</p>\n\n<p>Among the heads of divisions in this Department the changes have been\nexceedingly few. Three vacancies occurring from death and resignations have\nbeen filled by the promotion of assistants in the same divisions.</p>\n\n<p>These promotions of experienced and faithful assistants have not only been in\nthe interest of efficient work, but have suggested to those in the Department\nwho look for retention and promotion that merit and devotion to duty are their\nbest reliance.</p>\n\n<p>The amount appropriated for the Bureau of Animal Industry for the current\nfiscal year is $850,000. The estimate for the ensuing year is $700,000.</p>\n\n<p>The regulations of 1892 concerning Texas fever have been enforced during the\nlast year and the large stock yards of the country have been kept free from\ninfection. Occasional local outbreaks have been largely such as could have\nbeen effectually guarded against by the owners of the affected cattle.</p>\n\n<p>While contagious pleuro-pneumonia in cattle has been eradicated, animal\ntuberculosis, a disease widespread and more dangerous to human life than\npleuro-pneumonia, is still prevalent. Investigations have been made during the\npast year as to the means of its communication and the method of its correct\ndiagnosis. Much progress has been made in this direction by the studies of the\ndivision of animal pathology, but work ought to be extended, in cooperation\nwith local authorities, until the danger to human life arising from this cause\nis reduced to a minimum.</p>\n\n<p>The number of animals arriving from Canada during the year and inspected by\nBureau officers was 462,092, and the number from transatlantic countries was\n1,297. No contagious diseases were found among the imported animals.</p>\n\n<p>The total number of inspections of cattle for export during the past fiscal\nyear was 611,542. The exports show a falling off of about 25 per cent from the\npreceding year, the decrease occurring entirely in the last half of the year.\nThis suggests that the falling off may have been largely due to an increase in\nthe price of American export cattle.</p>\n\n<p>During the year ending June 30, 1893, exports of inspected pork aggregated\n10,677,410 pounds, as against 38,152,874 pounds for the preceding year. The\nfalling off in this export was not confined, however, to inspected pork, the\ntotal quantity exported for 1892 being 665,490,616 pounds, while in 1893 it\nwas only 527,308,695 pounds.</p>\n\n<p>I join the Secretary in recommending that hereafter each applicant for the\nposition of inspector or assistant inspector in the Bureau of Animal Industry\nbe required, as a condition precedent to his appointment, to exhibit to the\nUnited States Civil Service Commission his diploma from an established,\nregular, and reputable veterinary college, and that this be supplemented by\nsuch an examination in veterinary science as the Commission may prescribe.</p>\n\n<p>The exports of agricultural products from the United States for the fiscal\nyear ending June 30, 1892, attained the enormous figure of $800,000,000, in\nround numbers, being 78.7 per cent of our total exports. In the last fiscal\nyear this aggregate was greatly reduced, but nevertheless reached 615,000,000,\nbeing 75.1 per cent of all American commodities exported.</p>\n\n<p>A review of our agricultural exports with special reference to their\ndestination will show that in almost every line the United Kingdom of Great\nBritain and Ireland absorbs by far the largest proportion. Of cattle the total\nexports aggregated in value for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893,\n$26,000,000, of which Great Britain took considerably over $25,000,000. Of\nbeef products of all kinds our total exports were $28,000,000, of which Great\nBritain took $24,000,000. Of pork products the total exports were $84,000,000,\nof which Great Britain took $53,000,000. In breadstuffs, cotton, and minor\nproducts like proportions sent to the same destination are shown.</p>\n\n<p>The work of the statistical division of the Department of Agriculture deals\nwith all that relates to the economics of farming.</p>\n\n<p>The main purpose of its monthly reports is to keep the farmers informed as\nfully as possible of all matters having any influence upon the world\'s\nmarkets, in which their products find sale. Its publications relate especially\nto the commercial side of farming.</p>\n\n<p>It is therefore of profound importance and vital concern to the farmers of the\nUnited States, who represent nearly one-half of our population, and also of\ndirect interest to the whole country, that the work of this division be\nefficiently performed and that the information it has gathered be promptly\ndiffused.</p>\n\n<p>It is a matter for congratulation to know that the Secretary will not spare\nany effort to make this part of his work thoroughly useful.</p>\n\n<p>In the year 1839 the Congress appropriated $1,000, to be taken from the Patent\nOffice funds, for the purpose of collecting and distributing rare and improved\nvarieties of seeds and for prosecuting agricultural investigations and\nprocuring agricultural statistics. From this small beginning the seed division\nof the Department of Agriculture has grown to its present unwieldy and\nunjustifiably extravagant proportions.</p>\n\n<p>During the last fiscal year the cost of seeds purchased was $66,548.61. The\nremainder of an appropriation of $135,000 was expended in putting them up and\ndistributing them. It surely never could have entered the minds of those who\nfirst sanctioned appropriations of public money for the purchase of new and\nimproved varieties of seeds for gratuitous distribution that from this would\ngrow large appropriations for the purchase and distribution by members of\nCongress of ordinary seeds, bulbs, and cuttings which are common in all the\nStates and Territories and everywhere easily obtainable at low prices.</p>\n\n<p>In each State and Territory an agricultural experiment station has been\nestablished. These stations, by their very character and name, are the proper\nagencies to experiment with and test new varieties of seeds; and yet this\nindiscriminate and wasteful distribution by legislation and legislators\ncontinues, answering no purpose unless it be to remind constituents that their\nrepresentatives are willing to remember them with gratuities at public cost.</p>\n\n<p>Under the sanction of existing legislation there was sent out from the\nAgricultural Department during the last fiscal year enough of cabbage seed to\nplant 19,200 acres of land, a sufficient quantity of beans to plant 4,000\nacres, beet seed enough to plant 2,500 acres, sweet corn enough to plant 7,800\nacres, sufficient cucumber seed to cover 2,025 acres with vines, and enough\nmuskmelon and watermelon seeds to plant 2,675 acres. The total quantity of\nflower and vegetable seeds thus distributed was contained in more than\n9,000,000 packages, and they were sufficient if planted to cover 89,596 acres\nof land.</p>\n\n<p>In view of these facts this enormous expenditure without legitimate returns of\nbenefit ought to be abolished. Anticipating a consummation so manifestly in\nthe interest of good administration, more than $100,000 has been stricken from\nthe estimate made to cover this object for the year ending June 30, 1895; and\nthe Secretary recommends that the remaining $35,000 of the estimate be\nconfined strictly to the purchase of new and improved varieties of seeds, and\nthat these be distributed through experiment stations.</p>\n\n<p>Thus the seed will be tested, and after the test has been completed by the\nexperiment station the propagation of the useful varieties and the rejection\nof the valueless may safely be left to the common sense of the people.</p>\n\n<p>The continued intelligent execution of the civil-service law and the\nincreasing approval by the people of its operation are most gratifying. The\nrecent extension of its limitations and regulations to the employees at\nfree-delivery post-offices, which has been honestly and promptly accomplished\nby the Commission, with the hearty cooperation of the Postmaster-General, is\nan immensely important advance in the usefulness of the system.</p>\n\n<p>I am, if possible, more than ever convinced of the incalculable benefits\nconferred by the civil-service law, not only in its effect upon the public\nservice, but also, what is even more important, in its effect in elevating the\ntone of political life generally.</p>\n\n<p>The course of civil-service reform in this country instructively and\ninterestingly illustrates how strong a hold a movement gains upon our people\nwhich has underlying it a sentiment of justice and right and which at the same\ntime promises better administration of their Government.</p>\n\n<p>The law embodying this reform found its way to our statute book more from fear\nof the popular sentiment existing in its favor than from any love for the\nreform itself on the part of legislators, and it has lived and grown and\nflourished in spite of the covert as well as open hostility of spoilsmen and\nnotwithstanding the querulous impracticability of many self-constituted\nguardians. Beneath all the vagaries and sublimated theories which are\nattracted to it there underlies this reform a sturdy common-sense principle\nnot only suited to this mundane sphere, but whose application our people are\nmore and more recognizing to be absolutely essential to the most successful\noperation of their Government, if not to its perpetuity.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me to be entirely inconsistent with the character of this reform,\nas well as with its best enforcement, to oblige the Commission to rely for\nclerical assistance upon clerks detailed from other Departments. There ought\nnot to be such a condition in any Department that clerks hired to do work\nthere can be spared to habitually work at another place, and it does not\naccord with a sensible view of civil-service reform that persons should be\nemployed on the theory that their labor is necessary in one Department when in\npoint of fact their services are devoted to entirely different work in another\nDepartment.</p>\n\n<p>I earnestly urge that the clerks necessary to carry on the work of the\nCommission be regularly put upon its roster and that the system of obliging\nthe Commissioners to rely upon the services of clerks belonging to other\nDepartments be discontinued. This ought not to increase the expense to the\nGovernment, while it would certainly be more consistent and add greatly to the\nefficiency of the Commission.</p>\n\n<p>Economy in public expenditure is a duty that can not innocently be neglected\nby those intrusted with the control of money drawn from the people for public\nuses. It must be confessed that our apparently endless resources, the\nfamiliarity of our people with immense accumulations of wealth, the growing\nsentiment among them that the expenditure of public money should in some\nmanner be to their immediate and personal advantage, the indirect and almost\nstealthy manner in which a large part of our taxes is exacted, and a\ndegenerated sense of official accountability have led to growing extravagance\nin governmental appropriations.</p>\n\n<p>At this time, when a depleted public Treasury confronts us, when many of our\npeople are engaged in a hard struggle for the necessaries of life, and when\nenforced economy is pressing upon the great mass of our countrymen, I desire\nto urge with all the earnestness at my command that Congressional legislation\nbe so limited by strict economy as to exhibit an appreciation of the condition\nof the Treasury and a sympathy with the straitened circumstances of our\nfellow-citizens.</p>\n\n<p>The duty of public economy is also of immense importance in its intimate and\nnecessary relation to the task now in hand of providing revenue to meet\nGovernment expenditures and yet reducing the people\'s burden of Federal\ntaxation.</p>\n\n<p>After a hard struggle tariff reform is directly before us. Nothing so\nimportant claims our attention and nothing so clearly presents itself as both\nan opportunity and a duty--an opportunity to deserve the gratitude of our\nfellow-citizens and a duty imposed upon us by our oft-repeated professions and\nby the emphatic mandate of the people. After full discussion our countrymen\nhave spoken in favor of this reform, and they have confided the work of its\naccomplishment to the hands of those who are solemnly pledged to it.</p>\n\n<p>If there is anything in the theory of a representation in public places of the\npeople and their desires, if public officers are really the servants of the\npeople, and if political promises and professions have any binding force, our\nfailure to give the relief so long awaited will be sheer recreancy. Nothing\nshould intervene to distract our attention or disturb our effort until this\nreform is accomplished by wise and careful legislation.</p>\n\n<p>While we should stanchly adhere to the principle that only the necessity of\nrevenue justifies the imposition of tariff duties and other Federal taxation\nand that they should be limited by strict economy, we can not close our eyes\nto the fact that conditions have grown up among us which in justice and\nfairness call for discriminating care in the distribution of such duties and\ntaxation as the emergencies of our Government actually demand.</p>\n\n<p>Manifestly if we are to aid the people directly through tariff reform, one of\nits most obvious features should be a reduction in present tariff charges upon\nthe necessaries of life. The benefits of such a reduction would be palpable\nand substantial, seen and felt by thousands who would be better fed and better\nclothed and better sheltered. These gifts should be the willing benefactions\nof a Government whose highest function is the promotion of the welfare of the\npeople.</p>\n\n<p>Not less closely related to our people\'s prosperity and well-being is the\nremoval of restrictions upon the importation of the raw materials necessary to\nour manufactures. The world should be open to our national ingenuity and\nenterprise. This can not be while Federal legislation through the imposition\nof high tariff forbids to American manufacturers as cheap materials as those\nused by their competitors. It is quite obvious that the .enhancement of the\nprice of our manufactured products resulting from this policy not only\nconfines the market for these products within our own borders, to the direct\ndisadvantage of our manufacturers, but also increases their cost to our\ncitizens.</p>\n\n<p>The interests of labor are certainly, though indirectly, involved in this\nfeature of our tariff system. The sharp competition and active struggle among\nour manufacturers to supply the limited demand for their goods soon fill the\nnarrow market to which they are confined. Then follows a suspension of work in\nmills and factories, a discharge of employees, and distress in the homes of\nour workingmen.</p>\n\n<p>Even if the often-disproved assertion could be made good that a lower rate of\nwages would result from free raw materials and low tariff duties, the\nintelligence of our workmen leads them quickly to discover that their steady\nemployment, permitted by free raw materials, is the most important factor in\ntheir relation to tariff legislation.</p>\n\n<p>A measure has been prepared by the appropriate Congressional committee\nembodying tariff reform on the lines herein suggested, which will be promptly\nsubmitted for legislative action. It is the result of much patriotic and\nunselfish work, and I believe it deals with its subject consistently and as\nthoroughly as existing conditions permit.</p>\n\n<p>I am satisfied that the reduced tariff duties provided for in the proposed\nlegislation, added to existing internal-revenue taxation, will in the near\nfuture, though perhaps not immediately, produce sufficient revenue to meet the\nneeds of the Government.</p>\n\n<p>The committee, after full consideration and to provide against a temporary\ndeficiency which may exist before the business of the country adjusts itself\nto the new tariff schedules, have wisely embraced in their plan a few\nadditional internal-revenue taxes, including a small tax upon incomes derived\nfrom certain corporate investments.</p>\n\n<p>These new adjustments are not only absolutely just and easily borne, but they\nhave the further merit of being such as can be remitted without unfavorable\nbusiness disturbance whenever the necessity of their imposition no longer\nexists.</p>\n\n<p>In my great desire for the success of this measure I can not restrain the\nsuggestion that its success can only be attained by means of unselfish counsel\non the part of the friends of tariff reform and as a result of their\nwillingness to subordinate personal desires and ambitions to the general good.\nThe local interests affected by the proposed reform are so numerous and so\nvaried that if all are insisted upon the legislation embodying the reform must\ninevitably fail.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion my intense feeling of responsibility impels me to invoke for the\nmanifold interests of a generous and confiding people the most scrupulous care\nand to pledge my willing support to every legislative effort for the\nadvancement of the greatness and prosperity of our beloved country.</p>\n\n<p>GROVER CLEVELAND\n</p>\n\t\t\t<div class="textNav"><a href="#top">^ Return to top</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>\n\t<div id="footer"><strong><em>State of the Union</em></strong> is a project\n\t\tby Brad Borevitz at <a href="http://www.onetwothree.net">onetwothree.net</a></div>\n</div>\n<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">\n</script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n_uacct = "UA-410742-1";\nurchinTracker();\n</script>\n</body>\n<!-- InstanceEnd -->\n</html>\n'
