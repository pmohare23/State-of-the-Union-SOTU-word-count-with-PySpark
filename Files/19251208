Here and there are\ncomparatively small and apparently temporary difficulties needing\nadjustment and improved administrative methods, such as are always to be\nexpected, but in the fundamentals of government and business the results\ndemonstrate that we are going in the right direction. The country does not\nappear to require radical departures from the policies already adopted so\nmuch as it needs a further extension of these policies and the improvement\nof details. The age of perfection is still in the somewhat distant future,\nbut it is more in danger of being retarded by mistaken Government activity\nthan it is from lack of legislation. We are by far the most likely to\naccomplish permanent good if we proceed with moderation.</p>\n\n<p>In our country the people are sovereign and independent, and must accept\nthe resulting responsibilities. It is their duty to support themselves and\nsupport the Government. That is the business of the Nation, whatever the\ncharity of the Nation may require. The functions which the Congress are to\ndischarge are not those of local government but of National Government. The\ngreatest solicitude should be exercised to prevent any encroachment upon\nthe rights of the States or their various political subdivisions. Local\nself-government is one of our most precious possessions. It is the greatest\ncontributing factor to the stability strength liberty, and progress of the\nNation. It ought not to be in ringed by assault or undermined by purchase.\nIt ought not to abdicate its power through weakness or resign its authority\nthrough favor. It does not at all follow that because abuses exist it is\nthe concern of the Federal Government to attempt the r reform.</p>\n\n<p>Society is in much more danger from encumbering the National Government\nbeyond its wisdom to comprehend, or its ability to administer, than from\nleaving the local communities to bear their own burdens and remedy their\nown evils. Our local habit and custom is so strong, our variety of race and\ncreed is so great the Federal authority is so tenuous, that the area within\nwhich it can function successfully is very limited. The wiser policy is to\nleave the localities, so far as we can, possessed of their own sources of\nrevenue and charged with their own obligations.</p>\n\n<p>GOVERNMENT ECONOMY</p>\n\n<p>It is a fundamental principle of our country that the people are sovereign.\nWhile they recognize the undeniable authority of the state, they have\nestablished as its instrument a Government of limited powers. They hold\ninviolate in their own hands the jurisdiction over their own freedom and\nthe ownership of their own property. Neither of these can be impaired\nexcept by due process of law. The wealth of our country is not public\nwealth, but private wealth. It does not belong to the Government, it\nbelongs to the people. The Government has no justification in taking\nprivate Property except for a public purpose. It is always necessary to\nkeep these principles in mind in the laying of taxes and in the making of\nappropriations. No right exists to levy on a dollar, or to order the\nexpenditure of a dollar, of the money of the people, except for a necessary\npublic purpose duly authorized by the Constitution. The power over the\npurse is the power over liberty.</p>\n\n<p>That is the legal limitation within which the Congress can act, How it\nwill, proceed within this limitation is always a question of policy. When\nthe country is prosperous and free from debt, when the rate of taxation is\nlow, opportunity exists for assuming new burdens and undertaking new\nenterprises. Such a condition now prevails only to a limited extent. All\nproposals for assuming new obligations ought to be postponed, unless they\nare reproductive capital investments or are such as are absolutely\nnecessary at this time. We still have an enormous debt of over\n$20,000,000,000, on which the interest and sinking-fund requirements are\n$1,320,000,000. Our appropriations for the Pension Office and the Veterans\'\nBureau are $600,000,000. The War and Navy Departments call for\n$642,000,000. Other requirements, exclusive of the Post Office which is\nvirtually self-sustaining, brought the appropriations for the current year\nup to almost $3,100,060,000. This shows an expenditure of close to $30 for\nevery inhabitant of our country. For the average family of five it means a\ntax, directly or indirectly paid, of about $150 for national purposes\nalone. The local tax adds much more. These enormous expenditures ought not\nto be increased, but through every possible effort they ought to be\nreduced.</p>\n\n<p>Only one of these great items can be ultimately extinguished. That is the\nitem of our war debt. Already this has been reduced to about\n$6,000,000,000, which means an annual saving in interest of close to\n$250,000,000. The present interest charge is about $820,000,000 yearly. It\nwould seem to be obvious that the sooner this debt can be retired the more\nthe taxpayers will save in interest and the easier it will be to secure\nfunds with which to prosecute needed running expenses, constructions, and\nimprovements. This item of $820,000,000 for interest is a heavy charge on\nall the people of the country, and it seems to me that we might well\nconsider whether it is not greatly worth while to dispense with it as early\nas possible by retiring the principal debt which it is required to serve.</p>\n\n<p>It has always been our policy to retire our debts. That of the\nRevolutionary War period, notwithstanding the additions made in 1812, was\npaid by 1835. and the Civil War debt within 23 years. Of the amount already\npaid, over $1,000,000,000 is a reduction in cash balances. That source is\nexhausted. Over one and two-thirds billions of dollars was derived from\nexcess receipts. Tax reduction eliminates that. The sale of surplus war\nmaterials has been another element of our income. That is practically\nfinished. With these eliminated, the reduction of the debt has been only\nabout $500,000,000 each year, not an excessive sum on so large a debt.</p>\n\n<p>Proposals have been made to extend the payment over a period of 62 years.\nIf $1,000,000,000 is paid at the end of 20 years, the cost to the taxpayers\nis the principal and, if the interest is 4% per cent, a total of\n$1,850,000,000. If the same sum is paid at the end of 62 years, the cost is\n$3,635,000,000, or almost double. Here is another consideration: Compared\nwith its purchasing power in 1913, the dollar we borrowed represented but\n52 cents. As the value of our dollar increases, due to the falling prices\nof commodities, the burden of our debt increases. It has now risen to 631/2\ncents. The taxpayer will be required to produce nearly twice the amount of\ncommodities to pay his debt if the dollar returns to the 1913 value. The\nmore we pay while prices are high, the easier it will be.</p>\n\n<p>Deflation of government after a war period is slower than deflation of\nbusiness, where curtailment is either prompt and effective or disaster\nfollows. There is room for further economy in the cost of the Federal\nGovernment, but a co n of current expenditures with pre-war expenditures is\nnot able to the efficiency with which Government business is now being\ndone. The expenditures of 19161 the last pre-war year, were $742,000,000,\nand in 1925 over $3,500,000,000, or nearly five times as great. If we\nsubtract expenditures for debt retirements and interest, veterans\' relief,\nincrease of pensions, and other special outlays, consisting of refunds,\ntrust investments, and like charges, we find that the general expenditures\nof the Government in 1925 were slightly more than twice as large as in\n1916.</p>\n\n<p>As prices in 1925 were approximately 40 per cent higher than in 1916, the\ncost of the same Government must also have increased. But the Government is\nnot the same. It is more expensive to collect the much greater revenue\nnecessary and to administer our great debt. We have given enlarged and\nimproved services to agriculture and commerce. Above all, America has grown\nin population and wealth. Government expenditures must always share in\nthis growth. Taking into account the factors I have mentioned, I believe\nthat present Federal expenses are not far out of line with pre-war\nexpenses. We have nearly accomplished the deflation.</p>\n\n<p>This does not mean that further economies will not come. As we reduce our\ndebt our interest charges decline. There are many details yet to correct.\nThe real improvement, however, must come not from additional curtailment of\nexpenses, but by a more intelligent, more ordered spending. Our economy\nmust be constructive. While we should avoid as far as possible increases in\npermanent current expenditures, oftentimes a capital outlay like internal\nimprovements will result in actual constructive saving. That is economy in\nits best sense. It is an avoidance of waste that there may be the means for\nan outlay to-day which will bring larger returns to-morrow. We should\nconstantly engage in scientific studies of our future requirements and\nadopt an orderly program for their service. Economy is the method by which\nwe prepare to-day to afford the improvements of to-morrow.</p>\n\n<p>A mere policy of economy without any instrumentalities for putting it into\noperation would be very ineffective. The Congress has wisely set up the\nBureau of the Budget to investigate and inform the President what\nrecommendations he ought to make for current appropriations. This gives a\ncentralized authority where a general and comprehensive understanding can\nbe reached of the sources of income and the most equitable distribution of\nexpenditures. How well it has worked is indicated by the fact that the\ndepartmental estimates for 1922, before the budget law, were $4,068,000,000\nwhile the Budget estimates for 1927 are $3,156,000,000. This latter figure\nshows the reductions in departmental estimates for the coming year made\npossible by the operation of the Budget system that the Congress has\nprovided.</p>\n\n<p>But it is evidently not enough to have care in making appropriations\nwithout any restraint upon expenditure. The Congress has provided that\ncheck by establishing the office of Comptroller General.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of maintaining the Budget Director and the Comptroller General\nis to secure economy and efficiency in Government expenditure. No better\nmethod has been devised for the accomplishment of that end. These offices\ncan not be administered in all the various details without making some\nerrors both of fact and of judgment. But the important consideration\nremains that these are the instrumentalities of the Congress and that no\nother plan has ever been adopted which was so successful in promoting\neconomy and efficiency. The Congress has absolute authority over the\nappropriations and is free to exercise its judgment, as the evidence may\nwarrant, in increasing or decreasing budget recommendations. But it ought\nto resist every effort to weaken or break down this most beneficial system\nof supervising appropriations and expenditures. Without it all the claim of\neconomy would be a mere pretense.</p>\n\n<p>TAXATION</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of reducing expenditures is to secure a reduction in taxes.\nThat purpose is about to be realized. With commendable promptness the Ways\nand Means Committee of the House has undertaken in advance of the meeting\nof the Congress to frame a revenue act. As the bill has proceeded through\nthe committee it has taken on a nonpartisan character, and both Republicans\nand Democrats have joined in a measure which embodies many sound principles\nof tax reform. The bill will correct substantially the economic defects\ninjected into the revenue act of 1924, as well as many which have remained\nas war-time legacies. In its present form it should provide sufficient\nrevenue for the Government.</p>\n\n<p>The excessive surtaxes have been reduced, estate tax rates are restored to\nmore reasonable figures, with every prospect of withdrawing from the field\nwhen the States have had the opportunity to correct the abuses in their own\ninheritance tax laws, the gift tax and publicity section are to be repealed\nmany miscellaneous taxes are lowered or abandoned, and the Board of Tax\nAppeals and the administrative features of the law are improved and\nstrengthened. I approve of the bill in principle. In so far as income-tax\nexemptions are concerned, it seems, to me the committee has gone as far as\nit is Safe to go and somewhat further than I should have gone. Any further\nextension along these lines would, in my opinion, impair the integrity of\nour income-tax system.</p>\n\n<p>I am advised that the bill will be through the House by Christmas. For\nthis prompt action the country call thank the good sense of the Ways and\nMeans Committee in framing an economic measure upon economic\nconsiderations. If this attitude continues to be reflected through the\nCongress, the taxpayer will have his relief by the time his March 15th\ninstallment of income taxes is due. Nonpartisan effort means certain, quick\naction. Determination of a revenue law definitely, promptly and solely as a\nrevenue law, is one of the greatest gifts a legislature can bestow upon its\nconstituents. I commend the example of file Ways and Means Committee. If\nfollowed, it will place sound legislation upon the books in time to give\nthe taxpayers the full benefit of tax reduction next year. This means that\nthe bill should reach me prior to March 15.</p>\n\n<p>All these economic results are being sought not to benefit the rich, but to\nbenefit the people. They are for the purpose of encouraging industry in\norder that employment may be plentiful. They seek to make business good in\norder that wages may be good. They encourage prosperity in order that\npoverty may be banished from the home. They, seek to lay the foundation\nwhich, through increased production, may, give the people a more bountiful\nsupply of the necessaries of life, afford more leisure for the improvement\nof the mind, the appreciation of the arts of music and literature,\nsculpture and painting, and the beneficial enjoyment of outdoor sports and\nrecreation, enlarge the resources which minister to charity and by all\nthese means attempting to strengthen the spiritual life of the Nation.</p>\n\n<p>FOREIGN RELATIONS</p>\n\n<p>The policy of our foreign relations, casting aside any suggestion of force,\nrests solely on the foundation of peace, good will, and good works. We have\nsought, in our intercourse with other nations, better understandings\nthrough conference and exchange of views its befits beings endowed with\nreason. The results have been the gradual elimination of disputes, the\nsettlement of controversies, and the establishment of a firmer friendship\nbetween America and the rest of the world that has ever existed tit any\nprevious time.</p>\n\n<p>The example of this attitude has not been without its influence upon other\ncountries. Acting upon it, an adjustment was made of the difficult problem\nof reparations. This was the second step toward peace in Europe. It paved\nthe way for the agreements which were drawn up at the Locarno Conference.\nWhen ratified, these will represent the third step toward peace. While they\ndo not of themselves provide an economic rehabilitation, which is necessary\nfor the progress of Europe, by strengthening the guarantees of peace they\ndiminish the need for great armaments. If the energy which now goes into\nmilitary effort is transferred to productive endeavor it will greatly\nassist economic progress.</p>\n\n<p>The Locarno agreements were made by the, European countries directly\ninterested without any formal intervention of America, although on July 3\nI publicly advocated such agreements in an address made in Massachusetts.\nWe have consistently refrained from intervening except when our help has\nbeen sought and we have felt it could be effectively given, as in the\nsettlement of reparations and the London Conference. These recent Locarno\nagreements represent the success of this policy which we have been\ninsisting ought to be adopted, of having European countries settle their\nown political problems without involving this country. This beginning seems\nto demonstrate that this policy is sound. It is exceedingly gratifying to\nobserve this progress, both in its method and in its result promises so\nmuch that is beneficial to the world.</p>\n\n<p>When these agreements are finally adopted, they will provide guarantees of\npeace that make the present prime reliance upon force in some parts of\nEurope very much less necessary. The natural corollary to these treaties\nshould be further international contracts for the limitation of armaments.\nThis work was successfully begun at the Washington Conference. Nothing was\ndone at that time concerning land forces because of European objection. Our\nstanding army has been reduced to around 118,000, about the necessary\npolice force for 115,000,000 people. We are not proposing to increase it,\nnor is it supposable that any foreign country looks with the slightest\nmisapprehension upon our land forces. They do not menace anybody. They are\nrather a protection to everybody.</p>\n\n<p>The question of disarming upon land is so peculiarly European in its\npractical aspects that our country would look with particular gratitude\nupon any action which those countries might take to reduce their own\nmilitary forces. This is in accordance with our policy of not intervening\nunless the European powers are unable to agree and make request for our\nassistance. Whenever they are able to agree of their own accord it is\nespecially gratifying to its, and such agreements may be sure of our\nsympathetic support.</p>\n\n<p>It seems clear that it is the reduction of armies rather than of navies\nthat is of the first importance to the world at the present time. We shall\nlook with great satisfaction upon that effort and give it our approbation\nand encouragement. If that can be settled, we may more easily consider\nfurther reduction and limitation of naval armaments. For that purpose our\ncountry has constantly through its Executive, and through repeated acts of\nCongress, indicated its willingness to call such a conference. Under\ncongressional sanction it would seem to be wise to participate in any\nconference of the great powers for naval limitation of armament proposed\nupon such conditions that it would hold a fair promise of being effective.\nThe general policy of our country is for disarmament, and it ought not to\nhesitate to adopt any practical plan that might reasonably be expected to\nsucceed. But it would not care to attend a conference which from its\nlocation or constituency would in all probability prove futile.</p>\n\n<p>In the further pursuit, of strengthening the bonds of peace and good will\nwe have joined with other nations in an international conference held at\nGeneva and signed an agreement which will be laid before the Senate for\nratification providing suitable measures for control and for publicity in\ninternational trade in arms, ammunition, and implements of war, and also\nexecuted a protocol providing for a prohibition of the use of poison gas in\nwar, in accordance with the principles of Article 5 of the treaty relating\nthereto signed at the Washington Conference. We are supporting the Pan\nAmerican efforts that are being made toward the codification of\ninternational law, and looking with sympathy oil the investigations\nconducted under philanthropic auspices of the proposal to agreements\noutlawing war. In accordance with promises made at the Washington\nConference, we have urged the calling of and are now represented at the\nChinese Customs Conference and on the Commission on Extraterritoriality,\nwhere it will be our policy so far as possible to meet the, aspirations of\nChina in all ways consistent with the interests of the countries involved.</p>\n\n<p>COURT OF INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE</p>\n\n<p>Pending before the Senate for nearly three years is the proposal to adhere\nto the protocol establishing the Permanent Court of International Justice.\nA well-established line of precedents mark America\'s effort to effect the\nestablishment of it court of this nature.. We took a leading part in laying\nthe foundation on which it rests in the establishment of The Hague Court of\nArbitration. It is that tribunal which nominates the judges who are elected\nby the Council and Assembly of the League of Nations.</p>\n\n<p>The proposal submitted to the Senate was made dependent upon four\nconditions, the first of which is that by supporting the court we do not\nassume any obligations under the league; second, that we may participate\nupon an equality with other States in the election of judges; third, that\nthe Congress shall determine what part of the expenses we shall bear;\nfourth, that the statute creating the court shall not be amended without\nout consent; and to these I have proposed an additional condition to the\neffect that we are not to be bound by advisory opinions rendered without\nour consent.</p>\n\n<p>The court appears to be independent of the league. It is true the judges\nare elected by the Assembly and Council, but they are nominated by the\nCourt of Arbitration, which we assisted to create and of which we are a\npart. The court was created by it statute, so-called, which is really a\ntreaty made among some forty-eight different countries, that might properly\nbe called a constitution of the court. This statute provides a method by\nwhich the judges are chosen so that when the Court of Arbitration\nnominates them and the Assembly and Council of the League elect them, they\nare not acting as instruments of the Court of Arbitration or instruments of\nthe league, but as instruments of the statute.</p>\n\n<p>This will be even more apparent if our representatives sit with the members\nof the council and assembly in electing the judges. It is true they are\npaid through the league though not by the league, but by the countries\nwhich are members of the league and by our country if we accept the\nprotocol. The judges are paid by the league only in the same sense that it\ncould be said United States judges are paid by the Congress. The court\nderives all its authority from the statute and is so completely independent\nof the league that it could go on functioning if the league were disbanded,\nat least until the terms of the judges expired.</p>\n\n<p>The most careful provisions are made in the statute as to the\nqualifications of judges. Those who make the nominations are recommended to\nconsult with their highest court of justice, their law schools and\nacademies. The judges must be persons of high moral character, qualified to\nhold the highest judicial offices in that country, or be jurisconsults of\nrecognized competence in international law. It must be assumed that these\nrequirements will continue to be carefully met, and with America joining\nthe countries already concerned it is difficult to comprehend how human\ningenuity could better provide for the establishment of a court which would\nmaintain its independence. It has to be recognized that independence is to\na considerable extent a matter of ability, character, and personality. Some\neffort was made in the early beginnings to interfere with the independence\nof our Supreme Court. It did not succeed because of the quality of the men\nwho made up that tribunal.</p>\n\n<p>It does not seem that the authority to give advisory opinions interferes\nwith the independence of the court. Advisory opinions in and of themselves\nare not harmful, but may be used in such a way as to be very beneficial\nbecause they undertake to prevent injury rather than merely afford a remedy\nafter the injury has been done. As a principle that only implies that the\ncourt shall function when proper application is made to it. Deciding the\nquestion involved upon issues submitted for an advisory opinion does not\ndiffer materially from deciding the question involved upon issues submitted\nby contending parties. Up to the present time the court has given an\nadvisory opinion when it judged it had jurisdiction, and refused to give\none when it judged it did not have jurisdiction. Nothing in the work of the\ncourt has yet been an indication that this is an impairment of its\nindependence or that its practice differs materially from the giving of\nlike opinions under the authority of the constitutions of several of our\nStates.</p>\n\n<p>No provision of the statute seems to me to give this court any authority to\nbe a political rather than a judicial court. We have brought cases in this\ncountry before our courts which, when they have been adjudged to be\npolitical, have been thereby dismissed. It is not improbable that political\nquestions will be submitted to this court, but again up to the present time\nthe court has refused to pass on political questions and our support would\nundoubtedly have a tendency to strengthen it in that refusal.</p>\n\n<p>We are not proposing to subject ourselves to any compulsory jurisdiction.\nIf we support the court, we can never be obliged to submit any case which\ninvolves our interests for its decision. Our appearance before it would\nalways be voluntary, for the purpose of presenting a case which we had\nagreed might be presented. There is no more danger that others might bring\ncases before the court involving our interests which we did not wish to\nhave brought, after we have adhered, and probably not so much, than there\nwould be of bringing such cases if we do not adhere. I think that we would\nhave the same legal or moral right to disregard such a finding in the one\ncase that we would in the other.</p>\n\n<p>If we are going to support any court, it will not be one that we have set\nup alone or which reflects only our ideals. Other nations have their\ncustoms and their institutions, their thoughts and their methods of life.\nIf a court is going to be international, its composition will have to yield\nto what is good in all these various elements. Neither will it be possible\nto support a court which is exactly perfect, or under which we assume\nabsolutely no obligations. If we are seeking that opportunity, we might as\nwell declare that we are opposed to supporting any court. If any agreement\nis made, it will be because it undertakes to set up a tribunal which can do\nsome of the things that other nations wish to have done. We shall not find\nourselves bearing a disproportionate share of the world\'s burdens by our\nadherence, and we may as well remember that there is absolutely no escape\nfor our country from bearing its share of the world\'s burdens in any case.\nWe shall do far better service to ourselves and to others if we admit this\nand discharge our duties voluntarily, than if we deny it and are forced to\nmeet the same obligations unwillingly.</p>\n\n<p>It is difficult to imagine anything that would be more helpful to the world\nthan stability, tranquility and international justice. We may say that we\nare contributing to these factors independently, but others less\nfortunately located do not and can not make a like contribution except\nthrough mutual cooperation. The old balance of power, mutual alliances, and\ngreat military forces were not brought bout by any mutual dislike for\nindependence, but resulted from the domination of circumstances. Ultimately\nthey were forced on us. Like all others engaged in the war whatever we said\nas a matter of fact we joined an alliance, we became a military power, we\nimpaired our independence. We have more at stake than any one else in\navoiding a repetition of that calamity. Wars do not, spring into existence.\nThey arise from small incidents and trifling irritations which can be\nadjusted by an international court. We can contribute greatly to the\nadvancement of our ideals by joining with other nations in maintaining such\na tribunal.</p>\n\n<p>FOREIGN DEBTS</p>\n\n<p>Gradually, settlements have been made which provide for the liquidation of\ndebts due to our Government from foreign governments. Those made with Great\nBritain, Finland, Hungary Lithuania, and Poland have already been approved\nby the Congress. Since the adjournment, further agreements have been\nentered into with Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Latvia, Estonia, Italy, and\nRumania. These 11 nations, which have already made settlements, represent\n$6,419,528,641 of the original principal of the loans. The principal sums\nwithout interest, still pending, are the debt of France, of $3,340,000,000;\nGreece, $15,000,000; Yugoslavia, $.51,000,000; Liberia, $26,000; Russia,\n$192,000,000, which those at present in control have undertaken, openly to\nrepudiate; Nicaragua, $84,000, which is being paid currently; and Austria,\n$24,000,000, on which by act of Congress a moratorium of 20 years has been\ngranted. The only remaining sum is $12,000,000, due from Armenia, which has\nnow ceased to exist as an independent nation.</p>\n\n<p>In accordance with the settlements made, the amount of principal and\ninterest which is to be paid to the United States under these agreements\naggregate $15,200,688,253.93. It is obvious that the remaining settlements,\nwhich will undoubtedly be made, will bring this sum up to an amount which\nwill more than equal the principal due on our present national debt. While\nthese settlements are very large in the aggregate, it has been felt that\nthe terms granted were in all cases very generous. They impose no undue\nburden and are mutually beneficial in the observance of international faith\nand the improvement of international credit.</p>\n\n<p>Every reasonable effort will be made to secure agreements for liquidation\nwith the remaining countries, whenever they are in such condition that they\ncan be made. Those which have already been negotiated under the bipartisan\ncommission established by the Congress have been made only after the most\nthoroughgoing and painstaking investigation, continued for a long time\nbefore meeting with the representatives of the countries concerned. It is\nbelieved that they represent in each instance the best that can be done and\nthe wisest settlement that can be secured. One very important result is the\nstabilization of foreign currency, making exchange assist rather than\nembarrass our trade. Wherever sacrifices have been made of money, it will\nbe more than amply returned in better understanding and friendship, while\nin so far as these adjustments will contribute to the financial stability\nof the debtor countries, to their good order, prosperity, and progress,\nthey represent hope of improved trade relations and mutual contributions to\nthe civilization of the world.</p>\n\n<p>ALIEN PROBLEM</p>\n\n<p>Negotiations are progressing among the interested parties in relation to\nthe final distribution of the assets in the hands of the Alien Property\nCustodian. Our Government and people are interested as creditors; the\nGerman Government and people are interested as debtors and owners of the\nseized property. Pending the outcome of these negotiations, I do not\nrecommend any affirmative legislation. For the present we should continue\nin possession of this property which we hold as security for the settlement\nof claims due to our people and our Government.</p>\n\n<p>IMMIGRATION</p>\n\n<p>While not enough time has elapsed to afford a conclusive demonstration,\nsuch results as have been secured indicate that our immigration law is on\nthe whole beneficial. It is undoubtedly a protection to the wage earners of\nthis country. The situation should however, be carefully surveyed, in order\nto ascertain whether it is working a needless hardship upon our own\ninhabitants. If it deprives them of the comfort and society of those bound\nto them by close family ties, such modifications should be adopted as will\nafford relief, always in accordance with the principle that our Government\nowes its first duty to our own people and that no alien, inhabitant of\nanother country, has any legal rights whatever under our Constitution and\nlaws. It is only through treaty, or through residence here that such rights\naccrue. But we should not, however, be forgetful of the obligations of a\ncommon humanity.</p>\n\n<p>While our country numbers among its best citizens many of those of foreign\nbirth, yet those who now enter in violation of our laws by that very act\nthereby place themselves in a class of undesirables. Investigation\nreveals that any considerable number are coming here in defiance of our\nimmigration restrictions, it will undoubtedly create the necessity for the\nregistration of all aliens. We ought to have no prejudice against an alien\nbecause he is an alien. The standard which we apply to our inhabitants is\nthat of manhood, not place of birth. Restrictive immigration is to a large\ndegree for economic purposes. It is applied in order that we may not have a\nlarger annual increment of good people within our borders than we can weave\ninto our economic fabric in such a way as to supply their needs without\nundue injury to ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>NATIONAL DEFENSE</p>\n\n<p>Never before in time of peace has our country maintained so large and\neffective a military force as it now has. The Army, Navy, Marine Corps,\nNational Guard, and Organized Reserves represent a strength of about\n558,400 men. These forces are well trained, well equipped, and high in\nmorale.</p>\n\n<p>A sound selective service act giving broad authority for the mobilization\nin time of peril of all the resources of the country, both persons and\nmaterials, is needed to perfect our defense policy in accordance with our\nideals of equality. The provision for more suitable housing to be paid for\nout of funds derived from the sale of excess lands, pending before the last\nCongress, ought to be brought forward and passed. Reasonable replacements\nought to be made to maintain a sufficient ammunition reserve.</p>\n\n<p>The Navy has the full treaty tonnage of capital ships. Work is going\nforward in modernizing the older ones, building aircraft carriers,\nadditional fleet submarines, and fast scout cruisers, but we are carefully\navoiding anything that might be construed as a competition in armaments\nwith other nations. The joint Army and Navy maneuvers at Hawaii, followed\nby the cruise of a full Battle Fleet to Australia and New Zealand, were\nsuccessfully carried out. These demonstrations revealed a most satisfactory\ncondition of the ships and the men engaged.</p>\n\n<p>Last year at my suggestion the General Board of the Navy made an\ninvestigation and report on the relation of aircraft to warships. As a\nresult authorizations and appropriations were made for more scout cruisers\nand fleet submarines and for completing aircraft carriers and equipping\nthem with necessary planes. Additional training in aviation was begun at\nthe Military and Naval Academies. A method of coordination and cooperation\nof the Army and Navy and the principal aircraft builders is being\nperfected. At the suggestion of the Secretaries of War and Navy I appointed\na special board to make a further study of the problem of aircraft.</p>\n\n<p>The report of the Air Board ought to be reassuring to the country,\ngratifying to the service and satisfactory to the Congress. It is\nthoroughly complete and represents the mature thought of the best talent in\nthe country. No radical change in organization of the service seems\nnecessary. The Departments of War, Navy, and Commerce should each be\nprovided with an additional assistant secretary, not necessarily with\nstatutory duties but who would be available under the direction of the\nSecretary to give especial attention to air navigation. We must have an air\nstrength worthy of America. Provision should be made for two additional\nbrigadier generals for the Army Air Service. Temporary rank corresponding\nto their duties should be awarded to active flying officers in both Army\nand Navy.</p>\n\n<p>Aviation is of great importance both for national defense and commercial\ndevelopment. We ought to proceed in its improvement by the necessary\nexperiment and investigation. Our country is not behind in this art. It has\nmade records for speed and for the excellence of its planes. It ought to go\non maintaining its manufacturing plants capable of rapid production, giving\nnational assistance to the la in out of airways, equipping itself with a\nmoderate number of planes and keeping an air force trained to the highest\nefficiency.</p>\n\n<p>While I am a thorough believer in national defense and entirely committed\nto the policy of adequate preparation, I am just as thoroughly opposed to\ninstigating or participating in a policy of competitive armaments. Nor does\npreparation mean a policy of militarizing. Our people and industries are\nsolicitous for the cause of 0111, country, and have great respect for the\nArmy and Navy and foil the uniform worn by the men who stand ready at all\ntimes for our protection to encounter the dangers and perils necessary to\nmilitary service, but all of these activities are to be taken not in behalf\nof aggression but in behalf of peace. They are the instruments by which we\nundertake to do our part to promote good will and support stability among\nall peoples.</p>\n\n<p>VETERANS</p>\n\n<p>If any one desires to estimate the esteem in which the veterans of America\nare held by their fellow citizens, it is but necessary to remember that the\ncurrent budget calls for an expenditure of about $650,000.000 in their\nbehalf. This is nearly the amount of the total cost of the National\nGovernment, exclusive of the post office, before we entered the last war.</p>\n\n<p>At the two previous sessions of Congress legislation affecting veterans\'\nrelief was enacted and the law liberalized. This legislation brought into\nbeing a number of new provisions tending more nearly to meet the needs of\nour veterans, as well as afford the necessary authority to perfect the\nadministration of these laws.</p>\n\n<p>Experience with the new legislation so far has clearly demonstrated its\nconstructive nature. It has increased the benefits received by many and has\nmade eligible for benefits many others. Direct disbursements to the veteran\nor his dependents exceeding $21,000,000 have resulted, which otherwise\nwould not have been made. The degree of utilization of our hospitals has\nincreased through making facilities available to the incapacitated veteran\nregardless of service origin of the disability. This new legislation also\nhas brought about a marked improvement of service to the veteran.</p>\n\n<p>The organizations of ex-service men have proposed additional legislative\nchanges which you will consider, but until the new law and the\nmodifications made at the last session of Congress are given a more\nthorough test further changes in the basic law should be few and made only\nafter careful though sympathetic consideration.</p>\n\n<p>The principal work now before the Veterans\' Bureau is the perfection of its\norganization and further improvements in service. Some minor legislative\nchanges are deemed necessary to enable the bureau to retain that high grade\nof professional talent essential in handling the problems of the bureau.\nSuch changes as tend toward the improvement of service and the carrying\nforward to completion of the hospital construction program are recommended\nfor the consideration of the proper committees of Congress.</p>\n\n<p>With the enormous outlay that is now being made in behalf of the veterans\nand their dependents, with a tremendous war debt still requiring great\nannual expenditure, with the still high rate of taxation, while every\nprovision should be made for the relief of the disabled and the necessary\ncare of dependents, the Congress may well consider whether the financial\ncondition of the Government is not such that further bounty through the\nenlargement of general pensions and other emoluments ought not to be\npostponed.</p>\n\n<p>AGRICULTURE</p>\n\n<p>No doubt the position of agriculture as a whole has very much improved\nsince the depression of three and four years ago. But there are many\nlocalities and many groups of individuals, apparently through no fault of\ntheir own, sometimes due to climatic conditions and sometimes to the\nprevailing price of a certain crop, still in a distressing condition. This\nis probably temporary, but it is none the less acute. National Government\nagencies, the Departments of Agriculture and Commerce, the Farm Loan Board,\nthe intermediate credit banks, and the Federal Reserve Board are all\ncooperating to be of assistance and relief. On the other hand, there are\nlocalities and individuals who have had one of their most prosperous years.\nThe general price level is fair, but here again there are exceptions both\nways, some items being poor while others are excellent. In spite of a\nlessened production the farm income for this year will be about the same as\nlast year and much above the three preceding years.</p>\n\n<p>Agriculture is a very complex industry. It does not consist of one problem,\nbut of several. They can not be solved at one stroke. They have to be met\nin different ways, and small gains are not to be despised.</p>\n\n<p>It has appeared from all the investigations that I have been able to make\nthat the farmers as a whole are determined to maintain the independence of\ntheir business. They do not wish to have meddling on the part of the\nGovernment or to be placed under the inevitable restrictions involved in\nany system of direct or indirect price-fixing, which would result from\npermitting the Government to operate in the agricultural markets. They are\nshowing a very commendable skill in organizing themselves to transact their\nown business through cooperative marketing, which will this year turn over\nabout $2,500,000,000, or nearly one-fifth of the total agricultural\nbusiness. In this they are receiving help from the Government. The\nDepartment of Agriculture should be strengthened in this facility, in order\nto be able to respond when these marketing associations want help. While\nit ought not to undertake undue regulation, it should be equipped to give\nprompt information on crop prospects, supply, demand, current receipts,\nimports, exports, and prices.</p>\n\n<p>A bill embodying these principles, which has been drafted under the advice\nand with the approval of substantially all the leaders and managers in the\ncooperative movement, will be presented to the Congress for its enactment.\nLegislation should also be considered to provide for leasing the\nunappropriated public domain for grazing purposes and adopting a uniform\npolicy relative to grazing on the public lands and in the national\nforests.</p>\n\n<p>A more intimate relation should be established between agriculture and the\nother business activities of the Nation. They are mutually dependent and\ncan each advance their own prosperity most by advancing the prosperity of\nthe other. Meantime the Government will continue those activities which\nhave resulted in an unprecedented amount of legislation and the pouring out\nof great sums of money during the last five years. The work for good roads,\nbetter land and water transportation, increased support for agricultural\neducation, extension of credit facilities through the Farm Loan Boards and\nthe intermediate credit banks, the encouragement of orderly marketing and a\nrepression of wasteful speculation, will all be continued.</p>\n\n<p>Following every other depression, after a short period the price of farm\nproduce has taken and maintained the lead in the advance. This advance had\nreached a climax before the war. Everyone will recall the discussion that\nwent on for four or five years prior to 1914 concerning the high cost of\nliving. This history is apparently beginning to repeat itself. While\nwholesale prices of other commodities have been declining, farm prices have\nbeen increasing. There is every reason to suppose that a new era in\nagricultural prosperity lies just before us, which will probably be\nunprecedented.</p>\n\n<p>MUSCLE SHOALS</p>\n\n<p>The problem of Muscle Shoals seems to me to have assumed a place all out of\nproportion with its real importance. It probably does not represent in\nmarket value much more than a first-class battleship, yet it has been\ndiscussed in the Congress over a period of years and for months at a time.\nIt ought to be developed for the production of nitrates primarily, and\nincidentally for power purposes. This would serve defensive, agricultural,\nand industrial purposes. I am in favor of disposing of this property to\nmeet these purposes. The findings of the special commission will be\ntransmitted to the Congress for their information. I am convinced that the\nbest possible disposition can be made by direct authorization of the\nCongress. As a means of negotiation I recommend the immediate appointment\nof a small joint special committee chosen from the appropriate general\nstanding committees of the House and Senate to receive bids, which when\nmade should be reported with recommendations as to acceptance, upon which a\nlaw should be enacted, effecting a sale to the highest bidder who will\nagree to carry out these purposes.</p>\n\n<p>If anything were needed to demonstrate the almost utter incapacity of the\nNational Government to deal directly with an industrial and commercial\nproblem, it has been provided by our experience with this property. We have\nexpended vast fortunes, we have taxed everybody, but we are unable to\nsecure results, which benefit anybody. This property ought, to be\ntransferred to private management under conditions which will dedicate it\nto the public purpose for which it was conceived.</p>\n\n<p>RECLAMATION</p>\n\n<p>The National Government is committed to a policy of reclamation and\nirrigation which it desires to establish on a sound basis and continue in\nthe interest of the localities concerned. Exhaustive studies have recently\nbeen made of Federal reclamation, which have resulted in improving the\nprojects and adjusting many difficulties. About one third of the projects\nis in good financial condition, another third can probably be made\nprofitable, while the other third is under unfavorable conditions. The\nCongress has already provided for a survey which will soon be embodied in a\nreport. That ought to suggest a method of relief which will make\nunnecessary further appeals to the Congress. Unless this can be done,\nFederal reclamation will be considerably retarded. With the greatly\nincreased cost of construction and operation, it has become necessary to\nplan in advance, by community organization and selective agriculture,\nmethods sufficient to repay these increasing outlays.</p>\n\n<p>The human and economic interests of the farmer citizens suggest that the\nStates should be required to exert some effort and assume some\nresponsibility, especially in the intimate, detailed, and difficult work of\nsecuring settlers and developing farms which directly profit them, but only\nindirectly and remotely can reimburse the Nation. It is believed that the\nFederal Government should continue to be the agency for planning and\nconstructing the great undertakings needed to regulate and bring into use\nthe rivers the West, many of which are interstate in character, but the\ndetailed work of creating agricultural communities and a rural civilization\non the land made ready for reclamation ought to be either transferred to\nthe State in its entirety or made a cooperative effort of the State and\nFederal Government.</p>\n\n<p>SHIPPING</p>\n\n<p>The maintenance of a merchant marine is of the utmost importance for\nnational defense and the service of our commerce. We have a large number of\nships engaged in that service. We also have a surplus supply, costly to\ncare for, which ought to be sold. All the investigations that have been\nmade under my direction, and those which have been prosecuted\nindependently, have reached the conclusion that the fleet should be under\nthe direct control of a single executive head, while the Shipping Board\nshould exercise its judicial and regulatory functions in Accordance with\nits original conception. The report of Henry G. Dalton, a business man of\nbroad experience, with a knowledge of shipping, made to me after careful\ninvestigation, will be transmitted for the information of the Congress, the\nstudies pursued under the direction of the United States Chamber of\nCommerce will also be accessible, and added to these will be the report of\nthe special committee of the House.</p>\n\n<p>I do not advocate the elimination of regional considerations, but it has\nbecome apparent that without centralized executive action the management of\nthis great business, like the management of any other great business, will\nflounder in incapacity and languish under a division of council. A plain\nand unmistakable reassertion of this principle of unified control, which I\nhave always been advised was the intention of the Congress to apply, is\nnecessary to increase the efficiency of our merchant fleet.</p>\n\n<p>COAL</p>\n\n<p>The perennial conflict in the coal industry is still going on to the great\ndetriment of the wage earners, the owners, and especially to the public.\nWith deposits of coal in this country capable of supplying its needs for\nhundreds of years, inability to manage and control this great resource for\nthe benefit of all concerned is very close to a national economic failure.\nIt has been the subject of repeated investigation and reiterated\nrecommendation. Yet the industry seems never to have accepted modern\nmethods of adjusting differences between employers and employees. The\nindustry could serve the public much better and become subject to a much\nmore effective method of control if regional consolidations and more\nfreedom in the formation of marketing associations, under the supervision\nof the Department of Commerce, were permitted.</p>\n\n<p>At the present time the National Government has little or no authority to\ndeal with this vital necessity of the life of the country. It has permitted\nitself to remain so powerless that its only attitude must be humble\nsupplication. Authority should be lodged with the President and the\nDepartments of Commerce and Labor, giving them power to deal with an\nemergency. They should be able to appoint temporary boards with authority\nto call for witnesses and documents, conciliate differences, encourage\narbitration, and in case of threatened scarcity exercise control over\ndistribution. Making the facts public under these circumstances through a\nstatement from an authoritative source would be of great public benefit.\nThe report of the last coal commission should be brought forward,\nreconsidered, and acted upon.</p>\n\n<p>PROHIBITION</p>\n\n<p>Under the orderly processes of our fundamental institutions the\nConstitution was lately amended providing for national prohibition. The\nCongress passed an act for its enforcement, and similar acts have been\nprovided by most of the States. It is the law of the land. It is the duty\nof all who come under its, jurisdiction to observe the spirit of that law,\nand it is the duty of the Department of Justice and the Treasury Department\nto enforce it. Action to prevent smuggling, illegal transportation in\ninterstate commerce, abuse in the use of permits, and existence of sources\nof supply for illegal traffic is almost entirely imposed upon the Federal\nGovernment.</p>\n\n<p>Through treaties with foreign governments and increased activities of the\nCoast Guard, revenue agents, district attorneys and enforcement agents\neffort is being made to prevent these violations. But the Constitution also\nputs a concurrent duty on the States. We need their active and energetic\ncooperation, the vigilant action of their police, and the jurisdiction of\ntheir courts to assist in enforcement. I request of the people observance,\nof the public officers continuing efforts for enforcement, and of the\nCongress favorable action on the budget recommendation for the prosecution\nof this work.</p>\n\n<p>WATERWAY DEVELOPMENT</p>\n\n<p>For many years our country has been employed in plans and M for the\ndevelopment of our intracoastal and inland waterways. This work along our\ncoast is an important adjunct to our commerce. It will be carried on,\ntogether with the further opening up of our harbors, as our resources\npermit. The Government made an agreement during the war to take over the\nCape Cod Canal, under which the owners made valuable concessions. This\npledged faith of the Government ought to be redeemed.</p>\n\n<p>Two other main fields are under consideration. One is the Great Lakes and\nSt. Lawrence, including the Erie Canal. This includes stabilizing the lake\nlevel, and is both a waterway and power project. A joint commission of the\nUnited States and Canada is working on plans and surveys which will not be\ncompleted until next April. No final determination can be made, apparently,\nexcept under treaty as to the participation of both countries. The other is\nthe Mississippi River stem. This is almost entirely devoted to navigation.\nWork on the Ohio River will be completed in about three years. A modern\nchannel connecting Chicago, New Orleans, Kansas City, and Pittsburgh should\nbe laid out and work on the tributaries prosecuted. Some work is being done\nof a preparatory nature along the Missouri, and large expenditures are\nbeing made yearly in the lower reaches of the Mississippi and its\ntributaries which contribute both to flood control and navigation.\nPreliminary measures are being taken on the Colorado River project, which\nis exceedingly important for flood control, irrigation, power development,\nand water supply to the area concerned. It would seem to be very doubtful,\nhowever, whether it is practical to secure affirmative action of the\nCongress, except under a Joint agreement of the several States.</p>\n\n<p>The Government has already expended large sums upon scientific research and\nengineering investigation in promotion of this Colorado River project. The\nactual progress has been retarded for many years by differences among the\nseven States in the basin over their relative water rights and among\ndifferent groups as to methods. In an attempt to settle the primary\ndifficulty of the water rights, Congress authorized the Colorado River\nCommission which agreed on November 24, 1922, upon an interstate compact to\nsettle these rights, subject to the ratification of the State legislatures\nand Congress. All seven States except Arizona at one time ratified, the\nArizona Legislature making certain reservations which failed to meet the\napproval of the governor. Subsequently an attempt was made to establish the\ncompact upon a six-State basis, but in this case California imposed\nreservations. There appears to be no division of opinion upon the major\nprinciples of the compact, but difficulty in separating contentions to\nmethods of development from the discussion of it. It is imperative that\nflood control be undertaken for California and Arizona. preparation made\nfor irrigation, for power, and for domestic water.</p>\n\n<p>Some or all of these questions are combined in every proposed development.\nThe Federal Government is interested in some of these phases, State\ngovernments and municipalities and irrigation districts in others, and\nprivate corporations in still others. Because of all this difference of\nview it is most desirable that Congress should consider the creation of\nsome agency that will be able to determine methods of improvement solely\nupon economic and engineering facts, that would be authorized to negotiate\nand settle, subject to the approval of Congress, the participation, rights,\nand obligations of each group in any particular works. Only by some such\nmethod can early construction be secured.</p>\n\n<p>WATER POWER</p>\n\n<p>Along with the development of navigation should go every possible\nencouragement for the development of our water power. While steam still\nplays a dominant part, this is more and more becoming an era of\nelectricity. Once installed, the cost is moderate, has not tended greatly\nto increase, and is entirely free from the unavoidable dirt and\ndisagreeable features attendant upon the burning of coal. Every facility\nshould be extended for the connection of the various units into a\nsuperpower plant, capable at all times of a current increasing uniformity\nover the entire system.</p>\n\n<p>RAILROADS</p>\n\n<p>The railroads throughout the country are in a fair state of prosperity.\nTheir service is good and their supply of cars is abundant. Their condition\nwould be improved and the public better served by a system of\nconsolidations. I recommend that the Congress authorize such consolidations\ntinder the supervision of the Interstate Commerce Commission, with power to\napprove or disapprove when proposed parts are excluded or new parts added.\nI am informed that the railroad managers and their employees have reached a\nsubstantial agreement as to what legislation is necessary to regulate and\nimprove their relationship. Whenever they bring forward such proposals,\nwhich seem sufficient also to protect the interests of the public, they\nshould be enacted into law.</p>\n\n<p>It is gratifying to report that both the railroad managers and railroad\nemployees are providing boards for the mutual adjustment of differences in\nharmony with the principles of conference, conciliation, and arbitration.\nThe solution of their problems ought to be an example to all other\nindustries. Those who ask the protections of civilization should be ready\nto use the methods of civilization.</p>\n\n<p>A strike in modern industry has many of the aspects of war in the modern\nworld. It injures labor and it injures capital. If the industry involved is\na basic one, it reduces the necessary economic surplus and, increasing the\ncost of living, it injures the economic welfare and general comfort of the\nwhole people. It also involves a deeper cost. It tends to embitter and\ndivide the community into warring classes and thus weakens the unity and\npower of our national life.</p>\n\n<p>Labor can make no permanent gains at the cost of the general welfare. All\nthe victories won by organized labor in the past generation have been won\nthrough the support of public opinion. The manifest inclination of the\nmanagers and employees of the railroads to adopt a policy of action in\nharmony with these principles marks a new epoch in our industrial life.</p>\n\n<p>OUTLYING POSSESSIONS</p>\n\n<p>The time has come for careful investigation of the expenditures and success\nof the laws by which we have undertaken to administer our outlying\npossessions. A very large amount of money is being expended for\nadministration in Alaska. It appears so far out of proportion to the number\nof inhabitants and the amount of production as to indicate cause for\nthorough investigation. Likewise consideration should be given to the\nexperience under the law which governs the Philippines. From such reports\nas reach me there are indications that more authority should be given to\nthe Governor General, so that he will not be so dependent upon the local\nlegislative body to render effective our efforts to set an example of the,\nsound administration and good government, which is so necessary for the\npreparation of the Philippine people for self-government under ultimate\nindependence. If they are to be trained in these arts, it is our duty to\nprovide for them the best that there is.</p>\n\n<p>RETIREMENT OF JUDGES</p>\n\n<p>The act of March 3, 1911, ought to be amended so that the term of years of\nservice of judges of any court of the United States requisite for\nretirement with pay shall be computed to include not only continuous but\naggregate service.</p>\n\n<p>MOTHERS\' AID</p>\n\n<p>The Government ought always to be alert on the side of the humanities. It\nOught to encourage provisions for economic justice for the defenseless. It\nought to extend its relief through its national and local agencies, as may\nbe appropriate in each case, to the suffering and the needy. It ought to be\ncharitable.</p>\n\n<p>Although more than 40 of our States have enacted measures in aid of\nmotherhood, the District of Columbia is still without such a law. A\ncarefully considered bill will be presented, which ought to have most\nthoughtful consideration in order that the Congress may adopt a measure\nwhich will be hereafter a model for all parts of the Union.</p>\n\n<p>CIVIL SERVICE</p>\n\n<p>In 1883 the Congress passed the civil service act, which from a modest\nbeginning of 14,000 employees has grown until there are now 425,000 in the\nclassified service. This has removed the clerical force of the Nation from\nthe wasteful effects of the spoils system and made it more stable and\nefficient. The time has come to consider classifying all postmasters,\ncollectors of customs, collectors of internal revenue, and prohibition\nagents, by an act covering in those at present in office, except when\notherwise provided by Executive order.</p>\n\n<p>The necessary statistics are now being gathered to form the basis of a\nvaluation of the civil service retirement fund based on current conditions\nof the service. It is confidently expected that this valuation will be\ncompleted in time to be made available to the Congress during the present\nsession. It will afford definite knowledge of existing, and future\nliabilities under the present law and determination OF liabilities under\nany proposed change in the present law. We should have this information\nbefore creating further obligations for retirement annuities which will\nbecome liabilities to be met in the future from the money of the taxpayer.</p>\n\n<p>The classification act of 1923, with the subsequent legislative action\nproviding for adjustment of the compensation of field service positions,\nhas operated materially to improve employment conditions in the Federal\nservice. The administration of the act is in the hands of an impartial\nboard, functioning without the necessity of a direct appropriation. It\nwould be inadvisable at this time to place in other hands the\nadministration of this act.</p>\n\n<p>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</p>\n\n<p>The proper function of the Federal Trade Commission is to supervise and\ncorrect those practices in commerce which are detrimental to fair\ncompetition. In this it performs a useful function and should be continued\nand supported. It was designed also to be a help to honest business. In my\nmessage to the Sixty-eighth Congress I recommended that changes in the\nprocedure then existing be made. Since then the commission by its own\naction has reformed its rules, giving greater speed and economy in the\ndisposal of its cases and full opportunity for those accused to be heard.\nThese changes are improvements and, if necessary, provision should be made\nfor their permanency.</p>\n\n<p>REORGANIZATION</p>\n\n<p>No final action has yet been taken on the measure providing for the\nreorganization of the various departments. I therefore suggest that this\nmeasure, which will be of great benefit to the efficient and economical\nadministration of the business of the Government, be brought forward and\npassed.</p>\n\n<p>THE NEGRO</p>\n\n<p>Nearly one-tenth of our population consists of the Negro race. The progress\nwhich they have made in all the arts of civilization in the last 60 years\nis almost beyond belief. Our country has no more loyal citizens. But they\ndo still need sympathy, kindness, and helpfulness. They need reassurance\nthat the requirements of the Government and society to deal out to them\neven-handed justice will be met. They should be protected from all violence\nand supported in the peaceable enjoyment of the fruits of their labor.\nThose who do violence to them should be punished for their crimes. No other\ncourse of action is worthy of the American people.</p>\n\n<p>Our country has many elements in its population, many different modes of\nthinking and living, all of which are striving in their own way to be loyal\nto the high ideals worthy of the crown of American citizenship. It is\nfundamental of our institutions that they seek to guarantee to all our\ninhabitants the right to live their own lives under the protection of the\npublic law. This does not include any license to injure others materially,\nphysically, morally, to Incite revolution, or to violate the established\ncustoms which have long had the sanction of enlightened society.</p>\n\n<p>But it does mean the full right to liberty and equality before the law\nwithout distinction of race or creed. This condition can not be granted to\nothers, or enjoyed by ourselves, except by the application of the principle\nof broadest tolerance. Bigotry is only another name for slavery. It reduces\nto serfdom not only those against whom it is directed, but also those who\nseek to apply it. An enlarged freedom can only be secured by the\napplication of the golden rule. No other utterance ever presented such a\npractical rule of life.</p>\n\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n\n<p>It is apparent that we are reaching into an era of great general\nprosperity. It will continue only so long as we shall use it properly.\nAfter all, there is but a fixed quantity of wealth in this country at any\nfixed time. The only way that we can all secure more of it is to create\nmore. The element of time enters into production, If the people have\nsufficient moderation and contentment to be willing to improve their\ncondition by the process of enlarging production, eliminating waste, and\ndistributing equitably, a prosperity almost without limit lies before its.\nIf the people are to be dominated by selfishness, seeking immediate riches\nby nonproductive speculation and by wasteful quarreling over the returns\nfrom industry, they will be confronted by the inevitable results of\ndepression and privation. If they will continue industrious and thrifty,\ncontented with fair wages and moderate profits, and the returns which\naccrue from the development of oar natural resources, our prosperity will\nextend itself indefinitely.</p>\n\n<p>In all your deliberations you should remember that the purpose of\nlegislation is to translate principles into action. It is an effort to have\nour country be better by doing better. Because the thoughts and ways of\npeople are firmly fixed and not easily changed, the field within which\nimmediate improvement can be secured is very narrow. Legislation can\nprovide opportunity. Whether it is taken advantage of or not depends upon\nthe people themselves. The Government of the United States has been created\nby the people. It is solely responsible to them. It will be most successful\nif it is conducted solely for their benefit. All its efforts would be of\nlittle avail unless they brought more justice, more enlightenment, more\nhappiness and prosperity into the home. This means an opportunity to\nobserve religion, secure education, and earn a living under a reign of law\nand order. It is the growth and improvement of the material and spiritual\nlife of the Nation. We shall not be able to gain these ends merely by our\nown action. If they come at all, it will be because we have been willing to\nwork in harmony with the abiding purpose of a Divine Providence.\n</p>\n\t\t\t<div class="textNav"><a href="#top">^ Return to top</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>\n\t<div id="footer"><strong><em>State of the Union</em></strong> is a project\n\t\tby Brad Borevitz at <a href="http://www.onetwothree.net">onetwothree.net</a></div>\n</div>\n<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">\n</script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n_uacct = "UA-410742-1";\nurchinTracker();\n</script>\n</body>\n<!-- InstanceEnd -->\n</html>\n'
