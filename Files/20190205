Trump</h2>\n\t\t\t<h3>February 5, 2019</h3>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p>\nMadam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady\nof the United States, and my fellow Americans:</p>\n\n<p>We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential.  As we begin a new\nCongress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic\nbreakthroughs for all Americans.</p>\n\n<p>Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this\ngreat chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one\nNation.</p>\n\n<p>The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a\nDemocrat agenda.  It is the agenda of the American people.</p>\n\n<p>Many of us campaigned on the same core promises:  to defend American\njobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and\nrevitalize our Nation\'s infrastructure; to reduce the price of\nhealthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that\nis safe, lawful, modern and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that\nputs America\'s interests first.</p>\n\n<p>There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the\ncourage to seize it.  Victory is not winning for our party.  Victory is\nwinning for our country.</p>\n\n<p>This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show\nus the majesty of America\'s mission, and the power of American pride.</p>\n\n<p>In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D.\nEisenhower called the Great Crusade -- the Allied liberation of Europe\nin World War II.  On D-Day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men\njumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save\nour civilization from tyranny.  Here with us tonight are three of those\nheroes:  Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving\nLocker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik.  Gentlemen, we salute you.</p>\n\n<p>In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a\nquarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on\nthe face of the moon.  Half a century later, we are joined by one of the\nApollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag:  Buzz Aldrin.  This year,\nAmerican astronauts will go back to space on American rockets.</p>\n\n<p>In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, and\nredefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to\nsee.  Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this\ngreat American adventure, and we must create a new standard of living\nfor the 21st century.  An amazing quality of life for all of our\ncitizens is within our reach.</p>\n\n<p>We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture\nricher, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more\nprosperous than ever before.</p>\n\n<p>But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution\n-- and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and\nthe common good.</p>\n\n<p>Together, we can break decades of political stalemate.  We can bridge\nold divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new\nsolutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America\'s future. \nThe decision is ours to make.</p>\n\n<p>We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance,\nvision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction.</p>\n\n<p>Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness.</p>\n\n<p>Over the last 2 years, my Administration has moved with urgency and\nhistoric speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties\nover many decades.</p>\n\n<p>In just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an\nunprecedented economic boom -- a boom that has rarely been seen before. \nWe have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new\nmanufacturing jobs -- something which almost everyone said was\nimpossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started.</p>\n\n<p>Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue\ncollar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else. \nNearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps.  The United\nStates economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took\noffice, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere\nin the world.  Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a\ncentury. African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American\nunemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded.\nUnemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an\nall-time low.  More people are working now than at any time in our\nhistory - 157 million.</p>\n\n<p>We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child\ntax credit.</p>\n\n<p>We virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses,\nranches, and family farms.</p>\n\n<p>We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty --\nand to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we\npassed right to try.</p>\n\n<p>My Administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any\nother administration during its entire tenure.  Companies are coming\nback to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in\ntaxes and regulations.</p>\n\n<p>We have unleashed a revolution in American energy -- the United States\nis now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world.  And\nnow, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy.</p>\n\n<p>After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world,\nour military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each\nand every day.   Members of Congress:  the State of our Union is strong.\n Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before.</p>\n\n<p>On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last\nmonth alone -- almost double what was expected.  An economic miracle is\ntaking place in the United States -- and the only thing that can stop it\nare foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations.</p>\n\n<p>If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and\ninvestigation.  It just doesn\'t work that way!</p>\n\n<p>We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad.</p>\n\n<p>This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more\nthan 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate \nsome after years of waiting.  The Senate has failed to act on these\nnominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country.</p>\n\n<p>Now is the time for bipartisan action.  Believe it or not, we have\nalready proven that it is possible.</p>\n\n<p>In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented\nlegislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new Farm Bill,\nhistoric VA reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed VA\nAccountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our\nwonderful veterans.</p>\n\n<p>And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal\njustice reform.  Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice\nJohnson.  I was deeply moved.  In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in\nprison as a first-time non-violent drug offender.  Over the next two\ndecades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a\nbetter path.  She had a big impact on that prison population -- and far\nbeyond.</p>\n\n<p>Alice\'s story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist\nin criminal sentencing -- and the need to remedy this injustice.  She\nserved almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of\nher life.</p>\n\n<p>In June, I commuted Alice\'s sentence -- and she is here with us tonight.\n Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to\nshape our own destiny.</p>\n\n<p>When I saw Alice\'s beautiful family greet her at the prison gates,\nhugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did the right\nthing.</p>\n\n<p>Inspired by stories like Alice\'s, my Administration worked closely with\nmembers of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law.  This\nlegislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and\ndisproportionately harmed the African-American community.  The First\nStep Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as\nproductive, law-abiding citizens. Now, States across the country are\nfollowing our lead.  America is a Nation that believes in redemption.</p>\n\n<p>We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee.  In 1996,\nat age 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and\nrelated offenses.  Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30\nBible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates.  Now,\nMatthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the\nFirst Step Act.  Matthew, on behalf of all Americans:  welcome home.</p>\n\n<p>As we have seen, when we are united, we can make astonishing strides for\nour country.  Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to\nconfront an urgent national crisis.</p>\n\n<p>The Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our\nGovernment, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border.</p>\n\n<p>Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is\ncommitted to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless\ncoyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.</p>\n\n<p>As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United\nStates.  We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the\nillegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses\nto bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border\nprotection.  I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border\nto prepare for the tremendous onslaught.</p>\n\n<p>This is a moral issue.  The lawless state of our southern border is a\nthreat to the safety, security, and financial wellbeing of all\nAmericans.  We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that\nprotects the lives and jobs of our citizens.  This includes our\nobligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed\nthe rules and respected our laws.  Legal immigrants enrich our Nation\nand strengthen our society in countless ways.  I want people to come\ninto our country, but they have to come in legally.</p>\n\n<p>Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border\nout of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.</p>\n\n<p>No issue better illustrates the divide between America\'s working class\nand America\'s political class than illegal immigration.  Wealthy\npoliticians and donors push for open borders while living their lives\nbehind walls and gates and guards.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass\nillegal migration -- reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and\nhospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net.</p>\n\n<p>Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate -- it is cruel. \nOne in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. \nSmugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and\ngain access to our country.</p>\n\n<p>Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open\nareas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and\nwomen into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and\nmodern-day slavery.</p>\n\n<p>Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that\ncross our border and flood into our cities -- including meth, heroin,\ncocaine, and fentanyl.</p>\n\n<p>The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in 20 different American States,\nand they almost all come through our southern border.  Just yesterday,\nan MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a\nsubway platform in New York City.  We are removing these gang members by\nthe thousands, but until we secure our border they\'re going to keep\nstreaming back in.</p>\n\n<p>Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal\naliens.</p>\n\n<p>I\'ve gotten to know many wonderful Angel Moms, Dads, and families  no\none should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured.</p>\n\n<p>Here tonight is Debra Bissell.  Just three weeks ago, Debra\'s parents,\nGerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno,\nNevada, home by an illegal alien.  They were in their eighties and are\nsurvived by four children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren.\n Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon\'s granddaughter, Heather, and\ngreatgranddaughter, Madison.</p>\n\n<p>To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand:  few can understand your pain.\n But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and\nSharon, that it should never happen again.</p>\n\n<p>Not one more American life should be lost because our Nation failed to\ncontrol its very dangerous border.</p>\n\n<p>In the last 2 years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of\ncriminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000\nassaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings.</p>\n\n<p>We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes:  ICE\nSpecial Agent Elvin Hernandez.  When Elvin was a boy, he and his family\nlegally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic.  At\nthe age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special\nAgent.  Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international\nsex trafficking.  Elvin says:  "If I can make sure these young girls get\ntheir justice, I\'ve done my job."  Thanks to his work and that of his\ncolleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror\nand more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in\nthe last year.</p>\n\n<p>Special Agent Hernandez, please stand:  We will always support the brave\nmen and women of Law Enforcement -- and I pledge to you tonight that we\nwill never abolish our heroes from ICE.</p>\n\n<p>My Administration has sent to the Congress a commonsense proposal to end\nthe crisis on our southern border.</p>\n\n<p>It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug\ndetection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling,\nand plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas\nbetween our ports of entry.  In the past, most of the people in this\nroom voted for a wall -- but the proper wall never got built.  I\'ll get\nit built.</p>\n\n<p>This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier -- not just a\nsimple concrete wall.  It will be deployed in the areas identified by\nborder agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell\nyou, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down.</p>\n\n<p>San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country.\n In response, and at the request of San Diego residents and political\nleaders, a strong security wall was put in place.  This powerful barrier\nalmost completely ended illegal crossings.</p>\n\n<p>The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of\nviolent crime -- one of the highest in the country, and considered one\nof our Nation\'s most dangerous cities.  Now, with a powerful barrier in\nplace, El Paso is one of our safest cities.</p>\n\n<p>Simply put, walls work and walls save lives.  So let\'s work together,\ncompromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe.</p>\n\n<p>As we work to defend our people\'s safety, we must also ensure our\neconomic resurgence continues at a rapid pace.</p>\n\n<p>No one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who\nhave filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year.  All\nAmericans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than\never before -- and exactly one century after the Congress passed the\nConstitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have\nmore women serving in the Congress than ever before.</p>\n\n<p>As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere,\nthis Thursday we are launching the first ever Government-wide initiative\nfocused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries.</p>\n\n<p>To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount\n-- reversing decades of calamitous trade policies.</p>\n\n<p>We are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our\nindustries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of\nAmerican jobs and wealth has come to an end.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods\n-- and now our Treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a\ncountry that never gave us a dime.  But I don\'t blame China for taking\nadvantage of us -- I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing\nthis travesty to happen.  I have great respect for President Xi, and we\nare now working on a new trade deal with China.  But it must include\nreal, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our\nchronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs.</p>\n\n<p>Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA.</p>\n\n<p>I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana,\nNew Hampshire, and many other States whose dreams were shattered by\nNAFTA.  For years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a\nbetter deal.  But no one ever tried -- until now.</p>\n\n<p>Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement -- or USMCA -- will replace NAFTA\nand deliver for American workers:  bringing back our manufacturing jobs,\nexpanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and\nensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words: \nmade in the USA.</p>\n\n<p>Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade\nAct, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American\nproduct, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product\nthat they sell to us.</p>\n\n<p>Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America\'s\ncrumbling infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>I know that the Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill -- and\nI am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important\ninfrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge\nindustries of the future.  This is not an option.  This is a necessity.</p>\n\n<p>The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower\nthe cost of healthcare and prescription drugs -- and to protect patients\nwith pre-existing conditions.</p>\n\n<p>Already, as a result of my Administration\'s efforts, in 2018 drug prices\nexperienced their single largest decline in 46 years.</p>\n\n<p>But we must do more.  It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more\nthan people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in\nthe exact same place.  This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop\nit.</p>\n\n<p>I am asking the Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the\nproblem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price\ntransparency for American patients.  We should also require drug\ncompanies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to\nfoster competition and bring costs down.</p>\n\n<p>No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than\nAmerican freedom.  In recent years we have made remarkable progress in\nthe fight against HIV and AIDS.  Scientific breakthroughs have brought a\nonce-distant dream within reach.  My budget will ask Democrats and\nRepublicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic\nin the United States within 10 years.  Together, we will defeat AIDS in\nAmerica.</p>\n\n<p>Tonight, I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all\nAmericans can get behind:  the fight against childhood cancer.</p>\n\n<p>Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old\ngirl, Grace Eline.  Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her\nfriends to donate to St. Jude Children\'s Research Hospital.  She did not\nknow that one day she might be a patient herself.  Last year, Grace was\ndiagnosed with brain cancer.  Immediately, she began radiation\ntreatment.  At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more\nthan $40,000 for the fight against cancer.  When Grace completed\ntreatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their\neyes as she hung up a poster that read:  "Last Day of Chemo."  Grace --\nyou are an inspiration to us all.</p>\n\n<p>Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades.  My\nbudget will ask the Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to\nfund this critical life-saving research.</p>\n\n<p>To help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice\nfor America\'s children.  I am also proud to be the first President to\ninclude in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave -- so that\nevery new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.</p>\n\n<p>There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother\nholding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in\nrecent days.  Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the\npassage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the\nmother\'s womb moments before birth.  These are living, feeling,\nbeautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and\ndreams with the world.  And then, we had the case of the Governor of\nVirginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth.</p>\n\n<p>To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass\nlegislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel\npain in the mother\'s womb.</p>\n\n<p>Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. \nAnd let us reaffirm a fundamental truth:  all children -- born and\nunborn -- are made in the holy image of God.</p>\n\n<p>The final part of my agenda is to protect America\'s National Security.</p>\n\n<p>Over the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States\nMilitary -- with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year.  We\nare also getting other nations to pay their fair share.  For years, the\nUnited States was being treated very unfairly by NATO -- but now we have\nsecured a $100 billion increase in defense spending from NATO allies.</p>\n\n<p>As part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a\nstate-of-the-art Missile Defense System.</p>\n\n<p>Under my Administration, we will never apologize for advancing America\'s\ninterests.</p>\n\n<p>For example, decades ago the United States entered into a treaty with\nRussia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities. \nWhile we followed the agreement to the letter, Russia repeatedly\nviolated its terms.  That is why I announced that the United States is\nofficially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces\nTreaty, or INF Treaty.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others,\nor perhaps we can\'t - in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate\nall others by far.</p>\n\n<p>As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace\non the Korean Peninsula.  Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing\nhas stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months.  If I\nhad not been elected President of the United States, we would right now,\nin my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially\nmillions of people killed.  Much work remains to be done, but my\nrelationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one.  And Chairman Kim and I\nwill meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam.</p>\n\n<p>Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate\ngovernment of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Guaido.</p>\n\n<p>We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom --\nand we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist\npolicies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South\nAmerica into a state of abject poverty and despair.</p>\n\n<p>Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt\nsocialism in our country.  America was founded on liberty and\nindependence - not government coercion, domination, and control.  We are\nborn free, and we will stay free.  Tonight, we renew our resolve that\nAmerica will never be a socialist country.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the Middle East.</p>\n\n<p>Our approach is based on principled realism -- not discredited theories\nthat have failed for decades to yield progress.  For this reason, my\nAdministration recognized the true capital of Israel -- and proudly\nopened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.</p>\n\n<p>Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19\nyears.  In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given\ntheir lives.  More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded.  We\nhave spent more than $7 trillion in the Middle East.</p>\n\n<p>As a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach.  Great nations\ndo not fight endless wars.</p>\n\n<p>When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in\nIraq and Syria.  Today, we have liberated virtually all of that\nterritory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers.</p>\n\n<p>Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is\ntime to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home.</p>\n\n<p>I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement\nin Afghanistan.  Our troops have fought with unmatched valor -- and\nthanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution\nto this long and bloody conflict.</p>\n\n<p>In Afghanistan, my Administration is holding constructive talks with a\nnumber of Afghan groups, including the Taliban.  As we make progress in\nthese negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and\nfocus on counter-terrorism.  We do not know whether we will achieve an\nagreement -- but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has\ncome to at least try for peace.</p>\n\n<p>Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nation\'s power and\nwill to defend our people.  Eighteen years ago, terrorists attacked the\nUSS Cole -- and last month American forces killed one of the leaders of\nthe attack.</p>\n\n<p>We are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy\nSeaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. \nTom:  we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole.</p>\n\n<p>My Administration has acted decisively to confront the world\'s leading\nstate sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran.</p>\n\n<p>To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I\nwithdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal.  And\nlast fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a\ncountry.</p>\n\n<p>We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to America\nand threatens genocide against the Jewish people.  We must never ignore\nthe vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous\ncreed.  With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and\neverywhere it occurs.</p>\n\n<p>Just months ago, 11 Jewish-Americans were viciously murdered in an\nanti-semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh.  SWAT\nOfficer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times\nchasing down the killer.  Timothy has just had his 12th surgery -- but\nhe made the trip to be here with us tonight.  Officer Matson:  we are\nforever grateful for your courage in the face of evil.</p>\n\n<p>Tonight, we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor Judah Samet.  He\narrived at the synagogue as the massacre began.  But not only did Judah\nnarrowly escape death last fall -- more than seven decades ago, he\nnarrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps.  Today is Judah\'s 81st\nbirthday.  Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75\nyears ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his\nfamily were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp. \nSuddenly the train screeched to a halt.  A soldier appeared.  Judah\'s\nfamily braced for the worst.  Then, his father cried out with joy: \n"It\'s the Americans."</p>\n\n<p>A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a\nprisoner at Dachau Concentration Camp. He remembers watching through a\nhole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with\ntanks.  "To me," Joshua recalls, "the American soldiers were proof that\nGod exists, and they came down from the sky."</p>\n\n<p>I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in\nthe Second World War. One of them was Herman Zeitchik.  But there is\nmore to Herman\'s story.  A year after he stormed the beaches of\nNormandy, Herman was one of those American soldiers who helped liberate\nDachau.  He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that\nhell on earth.  Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both\ntogether in the gallery tonight -- seated side-by-side, here in the home\nof American freedom.  Herman and Joshua:  your presence this evening\nhonors and uplifts our entire Nation.</p>\n\n<p>When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English\nChannel in the early hours of D-Day, 1944, they were just young men of\n18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous\nbattle in the history of war.</p>\n\n<p>They did not know if they would survive the hour.  They did not know if\nthey would grow old.  But they knew that America had to prevail.  Their\ncause was this Nation, and generations yet unborn.</p>\n\n<p>Why did they do it?  They did it for America -- they did it for us.</p>\n\n<p>Everything that has come since -- our triumph over communism, our giant\nleaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality\nand justice -- all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and\ncourage and vision of the Americans who came before.</p>\n\n<p>Think of this Capitol -- think of this very chamber, where lawmakers\nbefore you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the\nhighways, to defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, to face down an\nevil empire.</p>\n\n<p>Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic.\n You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of\nHawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of\nArizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of\nCalifornia.  Together, we represent the most extraordinary Nation in all\nof history.</p>\n\n<p>What will we do with this moment?  How will we be remembered?</p>\n\n<p>I ask the men and women of this Congress:  Look at the opportunities\nbefore us!  Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead.  Our most\nexciting journeys still await.  Our biggest victories are still to come.\n We have not yet begun to dream.</p>\n\n<p>We must choose whether we are defined by our differences -- or whether\nwe dare to transcend them.</p>\n\n<p>We must choose whether we will squander our inheritance -- or whether we\nwill proudly declare that we are Americans.  We do the incredible.  We\ndefy the impossible.  We conquer the unknown.</p>\n\n<p>This is the time to re-ignite the American imagination.  This is the\ntime to search for the tallest summit, and set our sights on the\nbrightest star.  This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and\nloyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as\npatriots.</p>\n\n<p>This is our future -- our fate -- and our choice to make. I am asking\nyou to choose greatness.</p>\n\n<p>No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must\ngo forward together.</p>\n\n<p>We must keep America first in our hearts.  We must keep freedom alive in\nour souls.  And we must always keep faith in America\'s destiny -- that\none Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light\nand the glory among all the nations of the world!</p>\n\n<p>Thank you.  God Bless You, God Bless America, and good night!\n</p>\n\t\t\t<div class="textNav"><a href="#top">^ Return to top</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>\n\t<div id="footer"><strong><em>State of the Union</em></strong> is a project\n\t\tby Brad Borevitz at <a href="http://www.onetwothree.net">onetwothree.net</a></div>\n</div>\n<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">\n</script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n_uacct = "UA-410742-1";\nurchinTracker();\n</script>\n</body>\n<!-- InstanceEnd -->\n</html>\n'
