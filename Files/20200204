Trump</h2>\n\t\t\t<h3>February 4, 2020</h3>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p>\nMadam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady\nof the United States, and my fellow citizens:</p>\n\n<p>Three years ago, we launched the great American comeback. Tonight, I\nstand before you to share the incredible results. Jobs are booming,\nincomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence\nis surging, and our country is thriving and highly respected again!\nAmerica\'s enemies are on the run, America\'s fortunes are on the rise,\nand America\'s future is blazing bright.</p>\n\n<p>The years of economic decay are over. The days of our country being\nused, taken advantage of, and even scorned by other nations are long\nbehind us. Gone too are the broken promises, jobless recoveries, tired\nplatitudes, and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth,\npower, and prestige.</p>\n\n<p>In just 3 short years, we have shattered the mentality of American\ndecline, and we have rejected the downsizing of America\'s destiny. We\nare moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time\nago, and we are never going back!</p>\n\n<p>I am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it\nhas ever been. Our military is completely rebuilt, with its power being\nunmatched anywhere in the world and it is not even close. Our borders\nare secure. Our families are flourishing. Our values are renewed. Our\npride is restored. And for all these reasons, I say to the people of our\ngreat country, and to the Members of Congress before me: The State of\nour Union is stronger than ever before!</p>\n\n<p>The vision I will lay out this evening demonstrates how we are building\nthe world\'s most prosperous and inclusive society one where every\ncitizen can join in America\'s unparalleled success, and where every\ncommunity can take part in America\'s extraordinary rise.</p>\n\n<p>From the instant I took office, I moved rapidly to revive the United\nStates economy slashing a record number of job-killing regulations,\nenacting historic and record-setting tax cuts, and fighting for fair and\nreciprocal trade agreements. Our agenda is relentlessly pro-worker,\npro-family, pro-growth, and, most of all, pro-American. We are advancing\nwith unbridled optimism and lifting high our citizens of every race,\ncolor, religion, and creed.</p>\n\n<p>Since my election, we have created 7 million new jobs 5 million more\nthan Government experts projected during the previous administration.</p>\n\n<p>The unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century.</p>\n\n<p>Incredibly, the average unemployment rate under my Administration is\nlower than any administration in the history of our country. If we had\nnot reversed the failed economic policies of the previous\nadministration, the world would not now be witness to America\'s great\neconomic success.</p>\n\n<p>The unemployment rates for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and\nAsian-Americans have reached the lowest levels in history.\nAfrican-American youth unemployment has reached an all-time low.</p>\n\n<p>African-American poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded.</p>\n\n<p>The unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level in almost 70\nyears and last year, women filled 72 percent of all new jobs added.</p>\n\n<p>The veterans\' unemployment rate dropped to a record low.</p>\n\n<p>The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all-time\nlow.</p>\n\n<p>Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest\nunemployment rate recorded in United States history.</p>\n\n<p>A record number of young Americans are now employed.</p>\n\n<p>Under the last administration, more than 10 million people were added to\nthe food stamp rolls. Under my Administration, 7 million Americans have\ncome off of food stamps, and 10 million people have been lifted off of\nwelfare.</p>\n\n<p>In 8 years under the last administration, over 300,000 working-age\npeople dropped out of the workforce. In just 3 years of my\nAdministration, 3.5 million working-age people have joined the\nworkforce.</p>\n\n<p>Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage-earners has\nincreased by 47 percent 3 times faster than the increase for the top 1\npercent. After decades of flat and falling incomes, wages are rising\nfast and, wonderfully, they are rising fastest for low-income workers,\nwho have seen a 16 percent pay-increase since my election. This is a\nblue collar boom.</p>\n\n<p>Real median household income is now at the highest level ever recorded!</p>\n\n<p>Since my election, United States stock markets have soared 70 percent,\nadding more than $12 trillion to our Nation\'s wealth, transcending\nanything anyone believed was possible this, as other countries are not\ndoing well. Consumer confidence has reached amazing new heights.</p>\n\n<p>All of those millions of people with 401(k)s and pensions are doing far\nbetter than they have ever done before with increases of 60, 70, 80, 90,\nand even 100 percent.</p>\n\n<p>Jobs and investment are pouring into 9,000 previously-neglected\nneighborhoods thanks to Opportunity Zones, a plan spearheaded by Senator\nTim Scott as part of our great Republican tax cuts. In other words,\nwealthy people and companies are pouring money into poor neighborhoods\nor areas that have not seen investment in many decades, creating jobs,\nenergy, and excitement. This is the first time that these deserving\ncommunities have seen anything like this. It is all working!</p>\n\n<p>Opportunity Zones are helping Americans like Army Veteran Tony Rankins\nfrom Cincinnati, Ohio. After struggling with drug addiction, Tony lost\nhis job, his house, and his family he was homeless. But then Tony found\na construction company that invests in Opportunity Zones. He is now a\ntop tradesman, drug-free, reunited with his family, and he is here\ntonight. Tony: Keep up the great work.</p>\n\n<p>Our roaring economy has, for the first time ever, given many former\nprisoners the ability to get a great job and a fresh start. This second\nchance at life is made possible because we passed landmark Criminal\nJustice Reform into law. Everybody said that Criminal Justice Reform\ncould not be done, but I got it done, and the people in this room got it\ndone.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign, the United States has\nbecome the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world, by\nfar. With the tremendous progress we have made over the past 3 years,\nAmerica is now energy independent, and energy jobs, like so many\nelements of our country, are at a record high. We are doing numbers that\nno one would have thought possible just 3 years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, we are restoring our Nation\'s manufacturing might, even though\npredictions were that this could never be done. After losing 60,000\nfactories under the previous two administrations, America has now gained\n12,000 new factories under my Administration with thousands upon\nthousands of plants and factories being planned or built. We have\ncreated over half a million new manufacturing jobs. Companies are not\nleaving; they are coming back. Everybody wants to be where the action\nis, and the United States of America is, indeed, where the action is.</p>\n\n<p>One of the single biggest promises I made to the American people was to\nreplace the disastrous NAFTA trade deal. In fact, unfair trade is\nperhaps the single biggest reason that I decided to run for President.\nFollowing NAFTA\'s adoption, our Nation lost one in four manufacturing\njobs. Many politicians came and went, pledging to change or replace\nNAFTA only to do absolutely nothing. But unlike so many who came before\nme, I keep my promises. Six days ago, I replaced NAFTA and signed the\nbrand new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) into law.</p>\n\n<p>The USMCA will create nearly 100,000 new high-paying American auto jobs,\nand massively boost exports for our farmers, ranchers, and factory\nworkers. It will also bring trade with Mexico and Canada to a much\nhigher degree, but also to a much greater level of fairness and\nreciprocity. This is the first major trade deal in many years to earn\nthe strong backing of America\'s labor unions.</p>\n\n<p>I also promised our citizens that I would impose tariffs to confront\nChina\'s massive theft of American jobs. Our strategy worked. Days ago,\nwe signed the groundbreaking new agreement with China that will defend\nour workers, protect our intellectual property, bring billions of\ndollars into our treasury, and open vast new markets for products made\nand grown right here in the United States of America. For decades, China\nhas taken advantage of the United States, now we have changed that but,\nat the same time, we have perhaps the best relationship we have ever had\nwith China, including with President Xi. They respect what we have done\nbecause, quite frankly, they could never believe what they were able to\nget away with year after year, decade after decade, without someone in\nour country stepping up and saying: Enough. Now, we want to rebuild our\ncountry, and that is what we are doing.</p>\n\n<p>As we restore American leadership throughout the world, we are once\nagain standing up for freedom in our hemisphere. That is why my\nAdministration reversed the failing policies of the previous\nadministration on Cuba. We are supporting the hopes of Cubans,\nNicaraguans, and Venezuelans to restore democracy. The United States is\nleading a 59-nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator\nof Venezuela, Nicols Maduro. Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, a tyrant\nwho brutalizes his people. But Maduro\'s grip of tyranny will be smashed\nand broken. Here this evening is a man who carries with him the hopes,\ndreams, and aspirations of all Venezuelans. Joining us in the gallery is\nthe true and legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guaid. Mr.\nPresident, please take this message back to your homeland. All Americans\nare united with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for\nfreedom! Socialism destroys nations. But always remember, freedom\nunifies the soul.</p>\n\n<p>To safeguard American Liberty, we have invested a record-breaking $2.2\ntrillion in the United States Military. We have purchased the finest\nplanes, missiles, rockets, ships, and every other form of military\nequipment all made in the United States of America. We are also finally\ngetting our allies to help pay their fair share. I have raised\ncontributions from the other NATO members by more than $400 billion, and\nthe number of allies meeting their minimum obligations has more than\ndoubled. And just weeks ago, for the first time since President Truman\nestablished the Air Force more than 70 years earlier, we created a new\nbranch of the United States Armed Forces, the Space Force.</p>\n\n<p>In the gallery tonight, we have one of the Space Force\'s youngest\npotential recruits: 13-year-old Iain Lanphier, an eighth grader from\nArizona. Iain has always dreamed of going to space. He was first in his\nclass and among the youngest at an aviation academy. He aspires to go to\nthe Air Force Academy, and then, he has his eye on the Space Force. As\nIain says, "most people look up at space, I want to look down on the\nworld."</p>\n\n<p>Sitting beside Iain tonight is his great hero. Charles McGee was born in\nCleveland, Ohio, one century ago. Charles is one of the last surviving\nTuskegee Airmen the first black fighter pilots and he also happens to be\nIain\'s great-grandfather. After more than 130 combat missions in World\nWar II, he came back to a country still struggling for Civil Rights and\nwent on to serve America in Korea and Vietnam. On December 7th, Charles\ncelebrated his 100th birthday. A few weeks ago, I signed a bill\npromoting Charles McGee to Brigadier General. And earlier today, I\npinned the stars on his shoulders in the Oval Office. General McGee: Our\nNation salutes you.</p>\n\n<p>From the pilgrims to our Founders, from the soldiers at Valley Forge to\nthe marchers at Selma, and from President Lincoln to the Reverend Dr.\nMartin Luther King, Jr., Americans have always rejected limits on our\nchildren\'s future.</p>\n\n<p>Members of Congress, we must never forget that the only victories that\nmatter in Washington are victories that deliver for the American people.\nThe people are the heart of our country, their dreams are the soul of\nour country, and their love is what powers and sustains our country. We\nmust always remember that our job is to put America first!</p>\n\n<p>The next step forward in building an inclusive society is making sure\nthat every young American gets a great education and the opportunity to\nachieve the American Dream. Yet, for too long, countless American\nchildren have been trapped in failing government schools. To rescue\nthese students, 18 States have created school choice in the form of\nOpportunity Scholarships. The programs are so popular, that tens of\nthousands of students remain on waiting lists. One of those students is\nJaniyah Davis, a fourth grader from Philadelphia. Janiyah\'s mom\nStephanie is a single parent. She would do anything to give her daughter\na better future. But last year, that future was put further out of reach\nwhen Pennsylvania\'s Governor vetoed legislation to expand school choice\nfor 50,000 children.</p>\n\n<p>Janiyah and Stephanie are in the gallery this evening. But there is more\nto their story. Janiyah, I am pleased to inform you that your long wait\nis over. I can proudly announce tonight that an Opportunity Scholarship\nhas become available, it is going to you, and you will soon be heading\nto the school of your choice!</p>\n\n<p>Now, I call on the Congress to give 1 million American children the same\nopportunity Janiyah has just received. Pass the Education Freedom\nScholarships and Opportunity Act because no parent should be forced to\nsend their child to a failing government school.</p>\n\n<p>Every young person should have a safe and secure environment in which to\nlearn and grow. For this reason, our magnificent First Lady has launched\nthe "Be Best" initiative to advance a safe, healthy, supportive, and\ndrug-free life for the next generation, online, in school, and in our\ncommunities. Thank you, Melania, for your extraordinary love and\nprofound care for America\'s children.</p>\n\n<p>My Administration is determined to give our citizens the opportunities\nthey need regardless of age or background. Through our Pledge to\nAmerican Workers, over 400 companies will also provide new jobs and\neducation opportunities to almost 15 million Americans.</p>\n\n<p>My Budget also contains an exciting vision for our Nation\'s high\nschools. Tonight, I ask the Congress to support our students and back my\nplan to offer vocational and technical education in every single high\nschool in America.</p>\n\n<p>To expand equal opportunity, I am also proud that we achieved record and\npermanent funding for our Nation\'s Historically Black Colleges and\nUniversities.</p>\n\n<p>A good life for American families also requires the most affordable,\ninnovative, and high-quality healthcare system on Earth. Before I took\noffice, health insurance premiums had more than doubled in just 5 years.\nI moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives. Our new plans are up\nto 60 percent less expensive. I have also made an ironclad pledge to\nAmerican families: We will always protect patients with pre-existing\nconditions that is a guarantee. And we will always protect your Medicare\nand your Social Security.</p>\n\n<p>The American patient should never be blindsided by medical bills. That\nis why I signed an Executive Order requiring price transparency. Many\nexperts believe that transparency, which will go into full effect at the\nbeginning of next year, will be even bigger than healthcare reform. It\nwill save families massive amounts of money for substantially better\ncare.</p>\n\n<p>But as we work to improve Americans\' healthcare, there are those who\nwant to take away your healthcare, take away your doctor, and abolish\nprivate insurance entirely. One hundred thirty-two lawmakers in this\nroom have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our\nhealthcare system, wiping out the private health insurance plans of 180\nmillion Americans. To those watching at home tonight, I want you to\nknow: We will never let socialism destroy American healthcare!</p>\n\n<p>Over 130 legislators in this chamber have endorsed legislation that\nwould bankrupt our Nation by providing free taxpayer-funded healthcare\nto millions of illegal aliens, forcing taxpayers to subsidize free care\nfor anyone in the world who unlawfully crosses our borders. These\nproposals would raid the Medicare benefits our seniors depend on, while\nacting as a powerful lure for illegal immigration. This is what is\nhappening in California and other States their systems are totally out\nof control, costing taxpayers vast and unaffordable amounts of money. If\nforcing American taxpayers to provide unlimited free healthcare to\nillegal aliens sounds fair to you, then stand with the radical left. But\nif you believe that we should defend American patients and American\nseniors, then stand with me and pass legislation to prohibit free\nGovernment healthcare for illegal aliens!</p>\n\n<p>This will be a tremendous boon to our already very-strongly guarded\nsouthern border where, as we speak, a long, tall, and very powerful wall\nis being built. We have now completed over 100 miles and will have over\n500 miles fully completed by early next year.</p>\n\n<p>My Administration is also taking on the big pharmaceutical companies. We\nhave approved a record number of affordable generic drugs, and medicines\nare being approved by the FDA at a faster clip than ever before. I was\npleased to announce last year that, for the first time in 51 years, the\ncost of prescription drugs actually went down.</p>\n\n<p>And working together, the Congress can reduce drug prices substantially\nfrom current levels. I have been speaking to Senator Chuck Grassley of\nIowa and others in the Congress in order to get something on drug\npricing done, and done properly. I am calling for bipartisan legislation\nthat achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug\nprices. Get a bill to my desk, and I will sign it into law without\ndelay.</p>\n\n<p>With unyielding commitment, we are curbing the opioid epidemic drug\noverdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years. Among\nthe States hardest hit, Ohio is down 22 percent, Pennsylvania is down 18\npercent, Wisconsin is down 10 percent and we will not quit until we have\nbeaten the opioid epidemic once and for all.</p>\n\n<p>Protecting Americans\' health also means fighting infectious diseases. We\nare coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely\ntogether on the Coronavirus outbreak in China. My Administration will\ntake all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat.</p>\n\n<p>We have launched ambitious new initiatives to substantially improve care\nfor Americans with kidney disease, Alzheimer\'s, and those struggling\nwith mental health challenges. And because the Congress funded my\nrequest, we are pursuing new cures for childhood cancer, and we will\neradicate the AIDS epidemic in America by the end of the decade.</p>\n\n<p>Almost every American family knows the pain when a loved one is\ndiagnosed with a serious illness. Here tonight is a special man, someone\nbeloved by millions of Americans who just received a Stage 4 advanced\ncancer diagnosis. This is not good news, but what is good news is that\nhe is the greatest fighter and winner that you will ever meet. Rush\nLimbaugh: Thank you for your decades of tireless devotion to our\ncountry. Rush, in recognition of all that you have done for our Nation,\nthe millions of people a day that you speak to and inspire, and all of\nthe incredible work that you have done for charity, I am proud to\nannounce tonight that you will be receiving our country\'s highest\ncivilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. I will now ask the\nFirst Lady of the United States to please stand and present you with the\nhonor. Rush, Kathryn, congratulations!</p>\n\n<p>As we pray for all who are sick, we know that America is constantly\nachieving new medical breakthroughs. In 2017, doctors at St. Luke\'s\nhospital in Kansas City delivered one of the earliest premature babies\never to survive. Born at just 21 weeks and 6 days, and weighing less\nthan a pound, Ellie Schneider was born a fighter. Through the skill of\nher doctors and the prayers of her parents little Ellie kept on winning\nthe battle for life. Today, Ellie is a strong, healthy 2-year-old girl\nsitting with her amazing mother Robin in the gallery. Ellie and Robin:\nWe are so glad you are here.</p>\n\n<p>Ellie reminds us that every child is a miracle of life. Thanks to modern\nmedical wonders, 50 percent of very premature babies delivered at the\nhospital where Ellie was born now survive. Our goal should be to ensure\nthat every baby has the best chance to thrive and grow just like Ellie.\nThat is why I am asking the Congress to provide an additional $50\nmillion to fund neo-natal research for America\'s youngest patients. That\nis also why I am calling upon the Members of Congress here tonight to\npass legislation finally banning the late-term abortion of babies.</p>\n\n<p>Whether we are Republican, Democrat, or Independent, surely we must all\nagree that every human life is a sacred gift from God!</p>\n\n<p>As we support America\'s moms and dads, I was recently proud to sign the\nlaw providing new parents in the Federal workforce paid family leave,\nserving as a model for the rest of the country. Now, I call on the\nCongress to pass the bipartisan Advancing Support for Working Families\nAct, extending family leave to mothers and fathers all across the\nNation.</p>\n\n<p>Forty million American families have an average $2,200 extra thanks to\nour child tax credit. I have also overseen historic funding increases\nfor high-quality child care, enabling 17 States to serve more children,\nmany of which have reduced or eliminated their waitlists altogether. And\nI sent the Congress a plan with a vision to further expand access to\nhigh-quality childcare and urge you to act immediately.</p>\n\n<p>To protect the environment, days ago, I announced that the United States\nwill join the One Trillion Trees Initiative, an ambitious effort to\nbring together Government and the private sector to plant new trees in\nAmerica and around the world.</p>\n\n<p>We must also rebuild America\'s infrastructure. I ask you to pass Senator\nBarrasso\'s highway bill to invest in new roads, bridges, and tunnels\nacross our land.</p>\n\n<p>I am also committed to ensuring that every citizen can have access to\nhigh-speed internet, including rural America.</p>\n\n<p>A better tomorrow for all Americans also requires us to keep America\nsafe. That means supporting the men and women of law enforcement at\nevery level, including our Nation\'s heroic ICE officers.</p>\n\n<p>Last year, our brave ICE officers arrested more than 120,000 criminal\naliens charged with nearly 10,000 burglaries, 5,000 sexual assaults,\n45,000 violent assaults, and 2,000 murders.</p>\n\n<p>Tragically, there are many cities in America where radical politicians\nhave chosen to provide sanctuary for these criminal illegal aliens. In\nSanctuary Cities, local officials order police to release dangerous\ncriminal aliens to prey upon the public, instead of handing them over to\nICE to be safely removed.</p>\n\n<p>Just 29 days ago, a criminal alien freed by the Sanctuary City of New\nYork was charged with the brutal rape and murder of a 92-year-old woman.\nThe killer had been previously arrested for assault, but under New\nYork\'s sanctuary policies, he was set free. If the city had honored\nICE\'s detainer request, his victim would be alive today.</p>\n\n<p>The State of California passed an outrageous law declaring their whole\nState to be a sanctuary for criminal illegal immigrants with\ncatastrophic results.</p>\n\n<p>Here is just one tragic example. In December 2018, California police\ndetained an illegal alien with five prior arrests, including convictions\nfor robbery and assault. But as required by California\'s Sanctuary Law,\nlocal authorities released him.</p>\n\n<p>Days later, the criminal alien went on a gruesome spree of deadly\nviolence. He viciously shot one man going about his daily work; he\napproached a woman sitting in her car and shot her in the arm and the\nchest. He walked into a convenience store and wildly fired his weapon.\nHe hijacked a truck and smashed into vehicles, critically injuring\ninnocent victims. One of the victims of his bloody rampage was a\n51-year-old American named Rocky Jones. Rocky was at a gas station when\nthis vile criminal fired eight bullets at him from close range,\nmurdering him in cold blood. Rocky left behind a devoted family,\nincluding his brothers who loved him more than anything. One of his\ngrieving brothers is here with us tonight. Jody, would you please stand?\nJody, our hearts weep for your loss and we will not rest until you have\njustice.</p>\n\n<p>Senator Thom Tillis has introduced legislation to allow Americans like\nJody to sue Sanctuary Cities and States when a loved one is hurt or\nkilled as a result of these deadly policies. I ask the Congress to pass\nthe Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act immediately. The United\nStates of America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans not\ncriminal aliens!</p>\n\n<p>In the last 3 years, ICE has arrested over 5,000 wicked human\ntraffickers and I have signed 9 pieces of legislation to stamp out the\nmenace of human trafficking, domestically and around the globe.</p>\n\n<p>My Administration has undertaken an unprecedented effort to secure the\nsouthern border of the United States.</p>\n\n<p>Before I came into office, if you showed up illegally on our southern\nborder and were arrested, you were simply released and allowed into our\ncountry, never to be seen again. My Administration has ended\nCatch-and-Release. If you come illegally, you will now be promptly\nremoved. We entered into historic cooperation agreements with the\nGovernments of Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. As a result\nof our unprecedented efforts, illegal crossings are down 75 percent\nsince May dropping 8 straight months in a row. And as the wall goes up,\ndrug seizures rise, and border crossings go down.</p>\n\n<p>Last year, I traveled to the border in Texas and met Chief Patrol Agent\nRaul Ortiz. Over the last 24 months, Agent Ortiz and his team have\nseized more than 200,000 pounds of poisonous narcotics, arrested more\nthan 3,000 human smugglers, and rescued more than 2,000 migrants. Days\nago, Agent Ortiz was promoted to Deputy Chief of Border Patrol and he\njoins us tonight. Chief Ortiz: Please stand a grateful Nation thanks you\nand all the heroes of Border Patrol.</p>\n\n<p>To build on these historic gains, we are working on legislation to\nreplace our outdated and randomized immigration system with one based on\nmerit, welcoming those who follow the rules, contribute to our economy,\nsupport themselves financially, and uphold our values.</p>\n\n<p>With every action, my Administration is restoring the rule of law and\nre-asserting the culture of American freedom. Working with Senate\nMajority Leader McConnell and his colleagues in the Senate, we have\nconfirmed a record number of 187 new Federal judges to uphold our\nConstitution as written. This includes two brilliant new Supreme Court\nJustices, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh.</p>\n\n<p>My Administration is also defending religious liberty, and that includes\nthe Constitutional right to pray in public schools. In America, we do\nnot punish prayer. We do not tear down crosses. We do not ban symbols of\nfaith. We do not muzzle preachers and pastors. In America, we celebrate\nfaith. We cherish religion. We lift our voices in prayer, and we raise\nour sights to the Glory of God!</p>\n\n<p>Just as we believe in the First Amendment, we also believe in another\nConstitutional right that is under siege all across our country. So long\nas I am President I will always protect your Second Amendment right to\nkeep and bear arms.</p>\n\n<p>In reaffirming our heritage as a free Nation, we must remember that\nAmerica has always been a frontier nation. Now we must embrace the next\nfrontier, America\'s manifest destiny in the stars. I am asking the\nCongress to fully fund the Artemis program to ensure that the next man\nand the first woman on the moon will be American astronauts using this\nas a launching pad to ensure that America is the first nation to plant\nits flag on Mars.</p>\n\n<p>My Administration is also strongly defending our national security and\ncombating radical Islamic terrorism. Last week, I announced a\ngroundbreaking plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians.\nRecognizing that all past attempts have failed, we must be determined\nand creative in order to stabilize the region and give millions of young\npeople the change to realize a better future.</p>\n\n<p>Three years ago, the barbarians of ISIS held over 20,000 square miles of\nterritory in Iraq and Syria. Today, the ISIS territorial caliphate has\nbeen 100 percent destroyed, and the founder and leader of ISIS the\nbloodthirsty killer AlBaghdadi is dead!</p>\n\n<p>We are joined this evening by Carl and Marsha Mueller. After graduating\nfrom college, their beautiful daughter Kayla became a humanitarian aid\nworker. Kayla once wrote, "Some people find God in church. Some people\nfind God in nature. Some people find God in love; I find God in\nsuffering. I\'ve known for some time what my life\'s work is, using my\nhands as tools to relieve suffering." In 2013, while caring for\nsuffering civilians in Syria, Kayla was kidnapped, tortured, and\nenslaved by ISIS, and kept as a prisoner of Al-Baghdadi himself. After\nmore than 500 horrifying days of captivity, Al-Baghdadi murdered young\nKayla. She was just 26 years old.</p>\n\n<p>On the night that United States Special Forces Operators ended\nAlBaghdadi\'s miserable life, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,\nGeneral Mark Milley, received a call in the Situation Room. He was told\nthat the brave men of the elite Special Forces team, that so perfectly\ncarried out the operation, had given their mission a name "Task Force\n8-14." It was a reference to a special day: August 14th Kayla\'s\nbirthday. Carl and Marsha, America\'s warriors never forgot Kayla and\nneither will we.</p>\n\n<p>Every day, America\'s men and women in uniform demonstrate the infinite\ndepths of love that dwells in the human heart.</p>\n\n<p>One of these American heroes was Army Staff Sergeant Christopher Hake.\nOn his second deployment to Iraq in 2008, Sergeant Hake wrote a letter\nto his 1-year-old son, Gage: "I will be with you again," he wrote to\nGage. "I will teach you to ride your first bike, build your first sand\nbox, watch you play sports and see you have kids also. I love you son,\ntake care of your mother. I am always with you. Dad." On Easter Sunday\nof 2008, Chris was out on patrol in Baghdad when his Bradley Fighting\nVehicle was hit by a roadside bomb. That night, he made the ultimate\nsacrifice for our country. Sergeant Hake now rests in eternal glory in\nArlington, and his wife Kelli is in the gallery tonight, joined by their\nson, who is now 13 years old. To Kelli and Gage: Chris will live in our\nhearts forever.</p>\n\n<p>The terrorist responsible for killing Sergeant Hake was Qasem Soleimani,\nwho provided the deadly roadside bomb that took Chris\'s life. Soleimani\nwas the Iranian Regime\'s most ruthless butcher, a monster who murdered\nor wounded thousands of American service members in Iraq. As the world\'s\ntop terrorist, Soleimani orchestrated the deaths of countless men,\nwomen, and children. He directed the December assault on United States\nForces in Iraq, and was actively planning new attacks. That is why, last\nmonth, at my direction, the United States Military executed a flawless\nprecision strike that killed Soleimani and terminated his evil reign of\nterror forever.</p>\n\n<p>Our message to the terrorists is clear: You will never escape American\njustice. If you attack our citizens, you forfeit your life!</p>\n\n<p>In recent months, we have seen proud Iranians raise their voices against\ntheir oppressive rulers. The Iranian regime must abandon its pursuit of\nnuclear weapons, stop spreading terror, death, and destruction, and\nstart working for the good of its own people. Because of our powerful\nsanctions, the Iranian economy is doing very poorly. We can help them\nmake it very good in a short period of time, but perhaps they are too\nproud or too foolish to ask for that help. We are here. Let\'s see which\nroad they choose. It is totally up to them.</p>\n\n<p>As we defend American lives, we are working to end America\'s wars in the\nMiddle East.</p>\n\n<p>In Afghanistan, the determination and valor of our warfighters has\nallowed us to make tremendous progress, and peace talks are underway. I\nam not looking to kill hundreds of thousands of people in Afghanistan,\nmany of them innocent. It is also not our function to serve other\nnations as a law enforcement agency. These are warfighters, the best in\nthe world, and they either want to fight to win or not fight at all. We\nare working to finally end America\'s longest war and bring our troops\nback home!</p>\n\n<p>War places a heavy burden on our Nation\'s extraordinary military\nfamilies, especially spouses like Amy Williams from Fort Bragg, North\nCarolina, and her 2 children 6-year-old Elliana and 3-year-old Rowan.\nAmy works full time, and volunteers countless hours helping other\nmilitary families. For the past 7 months, she has done it all while her\nhusband, Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams, is in Afghanistan on\nhis fourth deployment to the Middle East. Amy\'s kids have not seen their\nfather\'s face in many months. Amy, your family\'s sacrifice makes it\npossible for all of our families to live in safety and peace we thank\nyou.</p>\n\n<p>As the world bears witness tonight, America is a land of heroes. This is\nthe place where greatness is born, where destinies are forged, and where\nlegends come to life. This is the home of Thomas Edison and Teddy\nRoosevelt, of many great Generals, including Washington, Pershing,\nPatton, and MacArthur. This is the home of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick\nDouglass, Amelia Earhart, Harriet Tubman, the Wright Brothers, Neil\nArmstrong, and so many more. This is the country where children learn\nnames like Wyatt Earp, Davy Crockett, and Annie Oakley. This is the\nplace where the pilgrims landed at Plymouth and where Texas patriots\nmade their last stand at the Alamo.</p>\n\n<p>The American Nation was carved out of the vast frontier by the toughest,\nstrongest, fiercest, and most determined men and women ever to walk the\nface of the Earth. Our ancestors braved the unknown; tamed the\nwilderness; settled the Wild West; lifted millions from poverty,\ndisease, and hunger; vanquished tyranny and fascism; ushered the world\nto new heights of science and medicine; laid down the railroads, dug out\ncanals, raised up the skyscrapers and, ladies and gentlemen, our\nancestors built the most exceptional Republic ever to exist in all of\nhuman history. And we are making it greater than ever before!</p>\n\n<p>This is our glorious and magnificent inheritance.</p>\n\n<p>We are Americans. We are the pioneers. We are the pathfinders. We\nsettled the new world, we built the modern world, and we changed history\nforever by embracing the eternal truth that everyone is made equal by\nthe hand of Almighty God.</p>\n\n<p>America is the place where anything can happen! America is the place\nwhere anyone can rise. And here, on this land, on this soil, on this\ncontinent, the most incredible dreams come true!</p>\n\n<p>This Nation is our canvas, and this country is our masterpiece. We look\nat tomorrow and see unlimited frontiers just waiting to be explored. Our\nbrightest discoveries are not yet known. Our most thrilling stories are\nnot yet told. Our grandest journeys are not yet made. The American Age,\nthe American Epic, the American Adventure, has only just begun!</p>\n\n<p>Our spirit is still young; the sun is still rising; God\'s grace is still\nshining; and my fellow Americans, the best is yet to come!</p>\n\n<p>Thank you. God Bless You. God Bless America.\n</p>\n\t\t\t<div class="textNav"><a href="#top">^ Return to top</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>\n\t<div id="footer"><strong><em>State of the Union</em></strong> is a project\n\t\tby Brad Borevitz at <a href="http://www.onetwothree.net">onetwothree.net</a></div>\n</div>\n<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">\n</script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n_uacct = "UA-410742-1";\nurchinTracker();\n</script>\n</body>\n<!-- InstanceEnd -->\n</html>\n'
