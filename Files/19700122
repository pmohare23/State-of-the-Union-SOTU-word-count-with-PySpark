This is such a time.</p>\n\n<p>I say this not only because 1970 marks the beginning of a new decade in\nwhich America will celebrate its 200th birthday. I say it because new\nknowledge and hard experience argue persuasively that both our programs and\nour institutions in America need to be reformed.</p>\n\n<p>The moment has arrived to harness the vast energies and abundance of this\nland to the creation of a new American experience, an experience richer and\ndeeper and more truly a reflection of the goodness and grace of the human\nspirit.</p>\n\n<p>The seventies will be a time of new beginnings, a time of exploring both on\nthe earth and in the heavens, a time of discovery. But the time has also\ncome for emphasis on developing better ways of managing what we have and of\ncompleting what man\'s genius has begun but left unfinished.</p>\n\n<p>Our land, this land that is ours together, is a great and a good land. It\nis also an unfinished land, and the challenge of perfecting it is the\nsummons of the seventies.</p>\n\n<p>It is in that spirit that I address myself to those great issues facing our\nNation which are above partisanship.</p>\n\n<p>When we speak of America\'s priorities the first priority must always be\npeace for America and the world.</p>\n\n<p>The major immediate goal of our foreign policy is to bring an end to the\nwar in Vietnam in a way that our generation will be remembered not so much\nas the generation that suffered in war, but more for the fact that we had\nthe courage and character to win the kind of a just peace that the next\ngeneration was able to keep.</p>\n\n<p>We are making progress toward that goal.</p>\n\n<p>The prospects for peace are far greater today than they were a year ago.</p>\n\n<p>A major part of the credit for this development goes to the Members of this\nCongress who, despite their differences on the conduct of the war, have\noverwhelmingly indicated their support of a just peace. By this action, you\nhave completely demolished the enemy\'s hopes that they can gain in\nWashington the victory our fighting men have denied them in Vietnam.</p>\n\n<p>No goal could be greater than to make the next generation the first in this\ncentury in which America was at peace with every nation in the world.</p>\n\n<p>I shall discuss in detail the new concepts and programs designed to achieve\nthis goal in a separate report on foreign policy, which I shall submit to\nthe Congress at a later date.</p>\n\n<p>Today, let me describe the directions of our new policies.</p>\n\n<p>We have based our policies on an evaluation of the world as it is, not as\nit was 25 years ago at the conclusion of World War II. Many of the policies\nwhich were necessary and right then are obsolete today.</p>\n\n<p>Then, because of America\'s overwhelming military and economic strength,\nbecause of the weakness of other major free world powers and the inability\nof scores of newly independent nations to defend, or even govern,\nthemselves, America had to assume the major burden for the defense of\nfreedom in the world.</p>\n\n<p>In two wars, first in Korea and now in Vietnam, we furnished most of the\nmoney, most of the arms, most of the men to help other nations defend their\nfreedom.</p>\n\n<p>Today the great industrial nations of Europe, as well as Japan, have\nregained their economic strength; and the nations of Latin America--and\nmany of the nations who acquired their freedom from colonialism after World\nWar II in Asia and Africa--have a new sense of pride and dignity and a\ndetermination to assume the responsibility for their own defense.</p>\n\n<p>That is the basis of the doctrine I announced at Guam.</p>\n\n<p>Neither the defense nor the development of other nations can be exclusively\nor primarily an American undertaking.</p>\n\n<p>The nations of each part of the world should assume the primary\nresponsibility for their own well-being; and they themselves should\ndetermine the terms of that well-being.</p>\n\n<p>We shall be faithful to our treaty commitments, but we shall reduce our\ninvolvement and our presence in other nations\' affairs.</p>\n\n<p>To insist that other nations play a role is not a retreat from\nresponsibility; it is a sharing of responsibility.</p>\n\n<p>The result of this new policy has been not to weaken our alliances, but to\ngive them new life, new strength, a new sense of common purpose.</p>\n\n<p>Relations with our European allies are once again strong and healthy, based\non mutual consultation and mutual responsibility.</p>\n\n<p>We have initiated a new approach to Latin America in which we deal with\nthose nations as partners rather than patrons.</p>\n\n<p>The new partnership concept has been welcomed in Asia. We have developed an\nhistoric new basis for Japanese-American friendship and cooperation, which\nis the linchpin for peace in the Pacific.</p>\n\n<p>If we are to have peace in the last third of the century, a major factor\nwill be the development of a new relationship between the United States and\nthe Soviet Union.</p>\n\n<p>I would not underestimate our differences, but we are moving with precision\nand purpose from an era of confrontation to an era of negotiation.</p>\n\n<p>Our negotiations on strategic arms limitations and in other areas will have\nfar greater chance for success if both sides enter them motivated by mutual\nself-interest rather than naive sentimentality.</p>\n\n<p>It is with this same spirit that we have resumed discussions with Communist\nChina in our talks at Warsaw.</p>\n\n<p>Our concern in our relations with both these nations is to avoid a\ncatastrophic collision and to build a solid basis for peaceful settlement\nof our differences.</p>\n\n<p>I would be the last to suggest that the road to peace is not difficult and\ndangerous, but I believe our new policies have contributed to the prospect\nthat America may have the best chance since World War II to enjoy a\ngeneration of uninterrupted peace. And that chance will be enormously\nincreased if we continue to have a relationship between Congress and the\nExecutive in which, despite differences in detail, where the security of\nAmerica and the peace of mankind are concerned, we act not as Republicans,\nnot as Democrats, but as Americans.</p>\n\n<p>As we move into the decade of the seventies, we have the greatest\nopportunity for progress at home of any people in world history.</p>\n\n<p>Our gross national product will increase by $500 billion in the next 10\nyears. This increase alone is greater than the entire growth of the\nAmerican economy from 1790 to 1950.</p>\n\n<p>The critical question is not whether we will grow, but how we will use that\ngrowth.</p>\n\n<p>The decade of the sixties was also a period of great growth economically.\nBut in that same 10-year period we witnessed the greatest growth of crime,\nthe greatest increase in inflation, the greatest social unrest in America\nin 100 years. Never has a nation seemed to have had more and enjoyed it\nless.</p>\n\n<p>At heart, the issue is the effectiveness of government.</p>\n\n<p>Ours has become--as it continues to be, and should remain--a society of\nlarge expectations. Government helped to generate these expectations. It\nundertook to meet them. Yet, increasingly, it proved unable to do so.</p>\n\n<p>As a people, we had too many visions--and too little vision.</p>\n\n<p>Now, as we enter the seventies, we should enter also a great age of reform\nof the institutions of American government.</p>\n\n<p>Our purpose in this period should not be simply better management of the\nprograms of the past. The time has come for a new quest--a quest not for a\ngreater quantity of what we have, but for a new quality of life in\nAmerica.</p>\n\n<p>A major part of the substance for an unprecedented advance in this Nation\'s\napproach to its problems and opportunities is contained in more than two\nscore legislative proposals which I sent to the Congress last year and\nwhich still await enactment.</p>\n\n<p>I will offer at least a dozen more major programs in the course of this\nsession.</p>\n\n<p>At this point I do not intend to go through a detailed listing of what I\nhave proposed or will propose, but I would like to mention three areas in\nwhich urgent priorities demand that we move and move now:</p>\n\n<p>First, we cannot delay longer in accomplishing a total reform of our\nwelfare system. When a system penalizes work, breaks up homes, robs\nrecipients of dignity, there is no alternative to abolishing that system\nand adopting in its place the program of income support, job training, and\nwork incentives which I recommended to the Congress last year.</p>\n\n<p>Second, the time has come to assess and reform all of our institutions of\ngovernment at the Federal, State, and local level. It is time for a New\nFederalism, in which, after 190 years of power flowing from the people and\nlocal and State governments to Washington, D.C., it will begin to flow from\nWashington back to the States and to the people of the United States.</p>\n\n<p>Third, we must adopt reforms which will expand the range of opportunities\nfor all Americans. We can fulfill the American dream only when each person\nhas a fair chance to fulfill his own dreams. This means equal voting\nrights, equal employment opportunity, and new opportunities for expanded\nownership. Because in order to be secure in their human rights, people need\naccess to property rights.</p>\n\n<p>I could give similar examples of the need for reform in our programs for\nhealth, education, housing, transportation, as well as other critical areas\nwhich directly affect the well-being of millions of Americans.</p>\n\n<p>The people of the United States should wait no longer for these reforms\nthat would so deeply enhance the quality of their life.</p>\n\n<p>When I speak of actions which would be beneficial to the American people, I\ncan think of none more important than for the Congress to join this\nadministration in the battle to stop the rise in the cost of living.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I realize it is tempting to blame someone else for inflation. Some\nblame business for raising prices. Some blame unions for asking for more\nwages.</p>\n\n<p>But a review of the stark fiscal facts of the 1960\'s clearly demonstrates\nwhere the primary blame for rising prices must be placed.</p>\n\n<p>In the decade of the sixties the Federal Government spent $57 billion more\nthan it took in in taxes.</p>\n\n<p>In that same decade the American people paid the bill for that deficit in\nprice increases which raised the cost of living for the average family of\nfour by $200 per month in America.</p>\n\n<p>Now millions of Americans are forced to go into debt today because the\nFederal Government decided to go into debt yesterday. We must balance our\nFederal budget so that American families will have a better chance to\nbalance their family budgets.</p>\n\n<p>Only with the cooperation of the Congress can we meet this highest priority\nobjective of responsible government. We are on the right track.</p>\n\n<p>We had a balanced budget in 1969. This administration cut more than $7\nbillion out of spending plans in order to produce a surplus in 1970, and in\nspite of the fact that Congress reduced revenues by $3 billion, I shall\nrecommend a balanced budget for 1971.</p>\n\n<p>But I can assure you that not only to present, but to stay within, a\nbalanced budget requires some very hard decisions. It means rejecting\nspending programs which would benefit some of the people when their net\neffect would result in price increases for all the people.</p>\n\n<p>It is time to quit putting good money into bad programs. Otherwise, we will\nend up with bad money and bad programs.</p>\n\n<p>I recognize the political popularity of spending programs, and particularly\nin an election year. But unless we stop the rise in prices, the cost of\nliving for millions of American families will become unbearable and\ngovernment\'s ability to plan programs for progress for the future will\nbecome impossible.</p>\n\n<p>In referring to budget cuts, there is one area where I have ordered an\nincrease rather than a cut--and that is the requests of those agencies with\nthe responsibilities for law enforcement.</p>\n\n<p>We have heard a great deal of overblown rhetoric during the sixties in\nwhich the word "war" has perhaps too often been used--the war on poverty,\nthe war on misery, the war on disease, the war on hunger. But if there is\none area where the word "war" is appropriate it is in the fight against\ncrime. We must declare and win the war against the criminal elements which\nincreasingly threaten our cities, our homes, and our lives.</p>\n\n<p>We have a tragic example of this problem in the Nation\'s Capital, for whose\nsafety the Congress and the Executive have the primary responsibility. I\ndoubt if many Members of this Congress who live more than a few blocks from\nhere would dare leave their cars in the Capitol garage and walk home alone\ntonight.</p>\n\n<p>Last year this administration sent to the Congress 13 separate pieces of\nlegislation dealing with organized crime, pornography, street crime,\nnarcotics, crime in the District of Columbia.</p>\n\n<p>None of these bills has reached my desk for signature.</p>\n\n<p>I am confident that the Congress will act now to adopt the legislation I\nplaced before you last year. We in the Executive have done everything we\ncan under existing law, but new and stronger weapons are needed in that\nfight.</p>\n\n<p>While it is true that State and local law enforcement agencies are the\ncutting edge in the effort to eliminate street crime, burglaries, murder,\nmy proposals to you have embodied my belief that the Federal Government\nshould play a greater role in working in partnership with these agencies.</p>\n\n<p>That is why 1971 Federal spending for local law enforcement will double\nthat budgeted for 1970.</p>\n\n<p>The primary responsibility for crimes that affect individuals is with local\nand State rather than with Federal Government. But in the field of\norganized crime, narcotics, pornography, the Federal Government has a\nspecial responsibility it should fulfill. And we should make Washington,\nD.C., where we have the primary responsibility, an example to the Nation\nand the world of respect for law rather than lawlessness.</p>\n\n<p>I now turn to a subject which, next to our desire for peace, may well\nbecome the major concern of the American people in the decade of the\nseventies.</p>\n\n<p>In the next 10 years we shall increase our wealth by 50 percent. The\nprofound question is: Does this mean we will be 50 percent richer in a real\nsense, 50 percent better off, 50 percent happier?</p>\n\n<p>Or does it mean that in the year 1980 the President standing in this place\nwill look back on a decade in which 70 percent of our people lived in\nmetropolitan areas choked by traffic, suffocated by smog, poisoned by\nwater, deafened by noise, and terrorized by crime?</p>\n\n<p>These are not the great questions that concern world leaders at summit\nconferences. But people do not live at the summit. They live in the\nfoothills of everyday experience, and it is time for all of us to concern\nourselves with the way real people live in real life.</p>\n\n<p>The great question of the seventies is, shall we surrender to our\nsurroundings, or shall we make our peace with nature and begin to make\nreparations for the damage we have done to our air, to our land, and to our\nwater?</p>\n\n<p>Restoring nature to its natural state is a cause beyond party and beyond\nfactions. It has become a common cause of all the people of this country.\nIt is a cause of particular concern to young Americans, because they more\nthan we will reap the grim consequences of our failure to act on programs\nwhich are needed now if we are to prevent disaster later.</p>\n\n<p>Clean air, clean water, open spaces--these should once again be the\nbirthright of every American. If we act now, they can be.</p>\n\n<p>We still think of air as free. But clean air is not free, and neither is\nclean water. The price tag on pollution control is high. Through our years\nof past carelessness we incurred a debt to nature, and now that debt is\nbeing called.</p>\n\n<p>The program I shall propose to Congress will be the most comprehensive and\ncostly program in this field in America\'s history.</p>\n\n<p>It is not a program for just one year. A year\'s plan in this field is no\nplan at all. This is a time to look ahead not a year, but 5 years or 10\nyears--whatever time is required to do the job.</p>\n\n<p>I shall propose to this Congress a $10 billion nationwide clean waters\nprogram to put modern municipal waste treatment plants in every place in\nAmerica where they are needed to make our waters clean again, and do it\nnow. We have the industrial capacity, if we begin now, to build them all\nwithin 5 years. This program will get them built within 5 years.</p>\n\n<p>As our cities and suburbs relentlessly expand, those priceless open spaces\nneeded for recreation areas accessible to their people are swallowed\nup--often forever. Unless we preserve these spaces while they are still\navailable, we will have none to preserve. Therefore, I shall propose new\nfinancing methods for purchasing open space and parklands now, before they\nare lost to us.</p>\n\n<p>The automobile is our worst polluter of the air. Adequate control requires\nfurther advances in engine design and fuel composition. We shall intensify\nour research, set increasingly strict standards, and strengthen enforcement\nprocedures--and we shall do it now.</p>\n\n<p>We can no longer afford to consider air and water common property, free to\nbe abused by anyone without regard to the consequences. Instead, we should\nbegin now to treat them as scarce resources, which we are no more free to\ncontaminate than we are free to throw garbage into our neighbor\'s yard.</p>\n\n<p>This requires comprehensive new regulations. It also requires that, to the\nextent possible, the price of goods should be made to include the costs of\nproducing and disposing of them without damage to the environment.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I realize that the argument is often made that there is a fundamental\ncontradiction between economic growth and the quality of life, so that to\nhave one we must forsake the other.</p>\n\n<p>The answer is not to abandon growth, but to redirect it. For example, we\nshould turn toward ending congestion and eliminating smog the same\nreservoir of inventive genius that created them in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Continued vigorous economic growth provides us with the means to enrich\nlife itself and to enhance our planet as a place hospitable to man.</p>\n\n<p>Each individual must enlist in this fight if it is to be won.</p>\n\n<p>It has been said that no matter how many national parks and historical\nmonuments we buy and develop, the truly significant environment for each of\nus is that in which we spend 80 percent of our time--in our homes, in our\nplaces of work, the streets over which we travel.</p>\n\n<p>Street litter, rundown parking strips and yards, dilapidated fences, broken\nwindows, smoking automobiles, dingy working places, all should be the\nobject of our fresh view.</p>\n\n<p>We have been too tolerant of our surroundings and too willing to leave it\nto others to clean up our environment. It is time for those who make\nmassive demands on society to make some minimal demands on themselves. Each\nof us must resolve that each day he will leave his home, his property, the\npublic places of the city or town a little cleaner, a little better, a\nlittle more pleasant for himself and those around him.</p>\n\n<p>With the help of people we can do anything, and without their help, we can\ndo nothing. In this spirit, together, we can reclaim our land for ours and\ngenerations to come.</p>\n\n<p>Between now and the year 2000, over 100 million children will be born in\nthe United States. Where they grow up--and how--will, more than any one\nthing, measure the quality of American life in these years ahead.</p>\n\n<p>This should be a warning to us.</p>\n\n<p>For the past 30 years our population has also been growing and shifting.\nThe result is exemplified in the vast areas of rural America emptying out\nof people and of promise--a third of our counties lost population in the\nsixties.</p>\n\n<p>The violent and decayed central cities of our great metropolitan complexes\nare the most conspicuous area of failure in American life today.</p>\n\n<p>I propose that before these problems become insoluble, the Nation develop a\nnational growth policy.</p>\n\n<p>In the future, government decisions as to where to build highways, locate\nairports, acquire land, or sell land should be made with a clear objective\nof aiding a balanced growth for America.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, the Federal Government must be in a position to assist in\nthe building of new cities and the rebuilding of old ones.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, we will carry our concern with the quality of life in\nAmerica to the farm as well as the suburb, to the village as well as to the\ncity. What rural America needs most is a new kind of assistance. It needs\nto be dealt with, not as a separate nation, but as part of an overall\ngrowth policy for America. We must create a new rural environment which\nwill not only stem the migration to urban centers, but reverse it. If we\nseize our growth as a challenge, we can make the 1970\'s an historic period\nwhen by conscious choice we transformed our land into what we want it to\nbecome.</p>\n\n<p>America, which has pioneered in the new abundance, and in the new\ntechnology, is called upon today to pioneer in meeting the concerns which\nhave followed in their wake--in turning the wonders of science to the\nservice of man.</p>\n\n<p>In the majesty of this great Chamber we hear the echoes of America\'s\nhistory, of debates that rocked the Union and those that repaired it, of\nthe summons to war and the search for peace, of the uniting of the people,\nthe building of a nation.</p>\n\n<p>Those echoes of history remind us of our roots and our strengths.</p>\n\n<p>They remind us also of that special genius of American democracy, which at\none critical turning point after another has led us to spot the new road to\nthe future and given us the wisdom and the courage to take it.</p>\n\n<p>As I look down that new road which I have tried to map out today, I see a\nnew America as we celebrate our 200th anniversary 6 years from now.</p>\n\n<p>I see an America in which we have abolished hunger, provided the means for\nevery family in the Nation to obtain a minimum income, made enormous\nprogress in providing better housing, faster transportation, improved\nhealth, and superior education.</p>\n\n<p>I see an America in which we have checked inflation, and waged a winning\nwar against crime.</p>\n\n<p>I see an America in which we have made great strides in stopping the\npollution of our air, cleaning up our water, opening up our parks,\ncontinuing to explore in space.</p>\n\n<p>Most important, I see an America at peace with all the nations of the\nworld.</p>\n\n<p>This is not an impossible dream. These goals are all within our reach.</p>\n\n<p>In times past, our forefathers had the vision but not the means to achieve\nsuch goals.</p>\n\n<p>Let it not be recorded that we were the first American generation that had\nthe means but not the vision to make this dream come true.</p>\n\n<p>But let us, above all, recognize a fundamental truth. We can be the best\nclothed, best fed, best housed people in the world, enjoying clean air,\nclean water, beautiful parks, but we could still be the unhappiest people\nin the world without an indefinable spirit--the lift of a driving dream\nwhich has made America, from its beginning, the hope of the world.</p>\n\n<p>Two hundred years ago this was a new nation of 3 million people, weak\nmilitarily, poor economically. But America meant something to the world\nthen which could not be measured in dollars, something far more important\nthan military might.</p>\n\n<p>Listen to President Thomas Jefferson in 1802: We act not "for ourselves\nalone, but for the whole human race."</p>\n\n<p>We had a spiritual quality then which caught the imagination of millions of\npeople in the world.</p>\n\n<p>Today, when we are the richest and strongest nation in the world, let it\nnot be recorded that we lack the moral and spiritual idealism which made us\nthe hope of the world at the time of our birth.</p>\n\n<p>The demands of us in 1976 are even greater than in 1776.</p>\n\n<p>It is no longer enough to live and let live. Now we must live and help\nlive.</p>\n\n<p>We need a fresh climate in America, one in which a person can breathe\nfreely and breathe in freedom.</p>\n\n<p>Our recognition of the truth that wealth and happiness are not the same\nthing requires us to measure success or failure by new criteria.</p>\n\n<p>Even more than the programs I have described today, what this Nation needs\nis an example from its elected leaders in providing the spiritual and moral\nleadership which no programs for material progress can satisfy.</p>\n\n<p>Above all, let us inspire young Americans with a sense of excitement, a\nsense of destiny, a sense of involvement, in meeting the challenges we face\nin this great period of our history. Only then are they going to have any\nsense of satisfaction in their lives.</p>\n\n<p>The greatest privilege an individual can have is to serve in a cause bigger\nthan himself. We have such a cause.</p>\n\n<p>How we seize the opportunities I have described today will determine not\nonly our future, but the future of peace and freedom in this world in the\nlast third of the century.</p>\n\n<p>May God give us the wisdom, the strength and, above all, the idealism to be\nworthy of that challenge, so that America can fulfill its destiny of being\nthe world\'s best hope for liberty, for opportunity, for progress and peace\nfor all peoples.\n</p>\n\t\t\t<div class="textNav"><a href="#top">^ Return to top</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>\n\t<div id="footer"><strong><em>State of the Union</em></strong> is a project\n\t\tby Brad Borevitz at <a href="http://www.onetwothree.net">onetwothree.net</a></div>\n</div>\n<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">\n</script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n_uacct = "UA-410742-1";\nurchinTracker();\n</script>\n</body>\n<!-- InstanceEnd -->\n</html>\n'
