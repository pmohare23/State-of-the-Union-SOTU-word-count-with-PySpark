Hayes</h2>\n\t\t\t<h3>December 3, 1877</h3>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p>\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:</p>\n\n<p>With devout gratitude to the bountiful Giver of All Good, I congratulate\nyou that at the beginning of your first regular session you find our\ncountry blessed with health and peace and abundant harvests, and with\nencouraging prospects of an early return of general prosperity.</p>\n\n<p>To complete and make permanent the pacification of the country continues to\nbe, and until it is fully accomplished must remain, the most important of\nall our national interests. The earnest purpose of good citizens generally\nto unite their efforts in this endeavor is evident. It found decided\nexpression in the resolutions announced in 1876 by the national conventions\nof the leading political parties of the country. There was a widespread\napprehension that the momentous results in our progress as a nation marked\nby the recent amendments to the Constitution were in imminent jeopardy;\nthat the good understanding which prompted their adoption, in the interest\nof a loyal devotion to the general welfare, might prove a barren truce, and\nthat the two sections of the country, once engaged in civil strife, might\nbe again almost as widely severed and disunited as they were when arrayed\nin arms against each other.</p>\n\n<p>The course to be pursued, which, in my judgment, seemed wisest in the\npresence of this emergency, was plainly indicated in my inaugural address.\nIt pointed to the time, which all our people desire to see, when a genuine\nlove of our whole country and of all that concerns its true welfare shall\nsupplant the destructive forces of the mutual animosity of races and of\nsectional hostility. Opinions have differed widely as to the measures best\ncalculated to secure this great end. This was to be expected. The measures\nadopted by the Administration have been subjected to severe and varied\ncriticism. Any course whatever which might have been entered upon would\ncertainly have encountered distrust and opposition. These measures were, in\nmy judgment, such as were most in harmony with the Constitution and with\nthe genius of our people, and best adapted, under all the circumstances, to\nattain the end in view. Beneficent results, already apparent, prove that\nthese endeavors are not to be regarded as a mere experiment, and should\nsustain and encourage us in our efforts. Already, in the brief period which\nhas elapsed, the immediate effectiveness, no less than the justice, of the\ncourse pursued is demonstrated, and I have an abiding faith that time will\nfurnish its ample vindication in the minds of the great majority of my\nfellow-citizens. The discontinuance of the use of the Army for the purpose\nof upholding local governments in two States of the Union was no less a\nconstitutional duty and requirement, under the circumstances existing at\nthe time, than it was a much-needed measure for the restoration of local\nself-government and the promotion of national harmony. The withdrawal of\nthe troops from such employment was effected deliberately, and with\nsolicitous care for the peace and good order of society and the protection\nof the property and persons and every right of all classes of citizens.</p>\n\n<p>The results that have followed are indeed significant and encouraging. All\napprehension of danger from remitting those States to local self-government\nis dispelled, and a most salutary change in the minds of the people has\nbegun and is in progress in every part of that section of the country once\nthe theater of unhappy civil strife, substituting for suspicion, distrust,\nand aversion, concord, friendship, and patriotic attachment to the Union.\nNo unprejudiced mind will deny that the terrible and often fatal collisions\nwhich for several years have been of frequent occurrence and have agitated\nand alarmed the public mind have almost entirely ceased, and that a spirit\nof mutual forbearance and hearty national interest has succeeded. There has\nbeen a general reestablishment of order and of the orderly administration\nof justice. Instances of remaining lawlessness have become of rare\noccurrence; political turmoil and turbulence have disappeared; useful\nindustries have been resumed; public credit in the Southern States has been\ngreatly strengthened, and the encouraging benefits of a revival of commerce\nbetween the sections of the country lately embroiled in civil war are fully\nenjoyed. Such are some of the results already attained, upon which the\ncountry is to be congratulated. They are of such importance that we may\nwith confidence patiently await the desired consummation that will surely\ncome with the natural progress of events.</p>\n\n<p>It may not be improper here to say that it should be our fixed and\nunalterable determination to protect by all available and proper means\nunder the Constitution and the laws the lately emancipated race in the\nenjoyment of their rights and privileges; and I urge upon those to whom\nheretofore the colored people have sustained the relation of bondmen the\nwisdom and justice of humane and liberal local legislation with respect to\ntheir education and general welfare. A firm adherence to the laws, both\nnational and State, as to the civil and political rights of the colored\npeople, now advanced to full and equal citizenship; the immediate\nrepression and sure punishment by the national and local authorities,\nwithin their respective jurisdictions, of every instance of lawlessness and\nviolence toward them, is required for the security alike of both races, and\nis justly demanded by the public opinion of the country and the age. In\nthis way the restoration of harmony and good will and the complete\nprotection of every citizen in the full enjoyment of every constitutional\nright will surely be attained. Whatever authority rests with me to this end\nI shall not hesitate to put forth.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever belongs to the power of Congress and the jurisdiction of the\ncourts of the Union, they may confidently be relied upon to provide and\nperform; and to the legislatures, the courts, and the executive authorities\nof the several States I earnestly appeal to secure, by adequate,\nappropriate, and seasonable means, Within their borders, these common and\nuniform rights of a united people which loves liberty, abhors oppression,\nand reveres justice. These objects are very dear to my heart. I shall\ncontinue most earnestly to strive for their attainment. The cordial\ncooperation of all classes, of all sections of the country and of both\nraces, is required for this purpose; and with these blessings assured, and\nnot otherwise, we may safely hope to hand down our free institutions of\ngovernment unimpaired to the generations that will succeed us.</p>\n\n<p>Among the other subjects of great and general importance to the people of\nthis country, I can not be mistaken, I think, in regarding as preeminent\nthe policy and measures which are designed to secure the restoration of the\ncurrency to that normal and healthful condition in which, by the resumption\nof specie payments, our internal trade and foreign commerce may be brought\ninto harmony with the system of exchanges which is based upon the precious\nmetals as the intrinsic money of the world. In the public judgment that\nthis end should be sought and compassed as speedily and securely as the\nresources of the people and the wisdom of their Government can accomplish,\nthere is a much greater degree of unanimity than is found to concur in the\nspecific measures which will bring the country to this desired end or the\nrapidity of the steps by which it can be safely reached.</p>\n\n<p>Upon a most anxious and deliberate examination, which I have felt it my\nduty to give to the subject, I am but the more confirmed in the opinion\nwhich I expressed in accepting the nomination for the Presidency, and again\nupon my inauguration, that the policy of resumption should be pursued by\nevery suitable means, and that no legislation would be wise that should\ndisparage the importance or retard the attainment of that result. I have no\ndisposition, and certainly no right, to question the sincerity or the\nintelligence of opposing opinions, and would neither conceal nor undervalue\nthe considerable difficulties, and even occasional distresses, which may\nattend the progress of the nation toward this primary condition to its\ngeneral and permanent prosperity. I must, however, adhere to my most\nearnest conviction that any wavering in purpose or unsteadiness in methods,\nso far from avoiding or reducing the inconvenience inseparable from the\ntransition from an irredeemable to a redeemable paper currency, would only\ntend to increased and prolonged disturbance in values, and unless retrieved\nmust end in serious disorder, dishonor, and disaster in the financial\naffairs of the Government and of the people.</p>\n\n<p>The mischiefs which I apprehend and urgently deprecate are confined to no\nclass of the people, indeed, but seem to me most certainly to threaten the\nindustrious masses, whether their occupations are of skilled or common\nlabor. To them, it seems to me, it is of prime importance that their labor\nshould be compensated in money which is itself fixed in exchangeable value\nby being irrevocably measured by the labor necessary to its production.\nThis permanent quality of the money of the people is sought for, and can\nonly be gained by the resumption of specie payments. The rich, the\nspeculative, the operating, the money-dealing classes may not always feel\nthe mischiefs of, or may find casual profits in, a variable currency, but\nthe misfortunes of such a currency to those who are paid salaries or wages\nare inevitable and remediless.</p>\n\n<p>Closely connected with this general subject of the resumption of specie\npayments is one of subordinate, but still of grave, importance; I mean the\nreadjustment of our coinage system by the renewal of the silver dollar as\nan element in our specie currency, endowed by legislation with the quality\nof legal tender to a greater or less extent.</p>\n\n<p>As there is no doubt of the power of Congress under the Constitution "to\ncoin money and regulate the value thereof," and as this power covers the\nwhole range of authority applicable to the metal, the rated value and the\nlegal-tender quality which shall be adopted for the coinage, the\nconsiderations which should induce or discourage a particular measure\nconnected with the coinage, belong clearly to the province of legislative\ndiscretion and of public expediency. Without intruding upon this province\nof legislation in the least, I have yet thought the subject of such\ncritical importance, in the actual condition of our affairs, as to present\nan occasion for the exercise of the duty imposed by the Constitution on the\nPresident of recommending to the consideration of Congress "such measures\nas he shall judge necessary and expedient."</p>\n\n<p>Holding the opinion, as I do, that neither the interests of the Government\nnor of the people of the United States would be promoted by disparaging\nsilver as one of the two precious metals which furnish the coinage of the\nworld, and that legislation which looks to maintaining the volume of\nintrinsic money to as full a measure of both metals as their relative\ncommercial values will permit would be neither unjust nor inexpedient, I\nmust ask your indulgence to a brief and definite statement of certain\nessential features in any such legislative measure which I feel it my duty\nto recommend.</p>\n\n<p>I do not propose to enter the debate, represented on both sides by such\nable disputants in Congress and before the people and in the press, as to\nthe extent to which the legislation of any one nation can control this\nquestion, even within its own borders, against the unwritten laws of trade\nor the positive laws of other governments. The wisdom of Congress in\nshaping any particular law that may be presented for my approval may wholly\nsupersede the necessity of my entering into these considerations, and I\nwillingly avoid either vague or intricate inquiries. It is only certain\nplain and practical traits of such legislation that I desire to recommend\nto your attention.</p>\n\n<p>In any legislation providing for a silver coinage, regulating its value,\nand imparting to it the quality of legal tender, it seems to me of great\nimportance that Congress should not lose sight of its action as operating\nin a twofold capacity and in two distinct directions. If the United States\nGovernment were free from a public debt, its legislative dealing with the\nquestion of silver coinage would be purely sovereign and governmental,\nunder no restraints but those of constitutional power and the public good\nas affected by the proposed legislation. But in the actual circumstances of\nthe nation, with a vast public debt distributed very widely among our own\ncitizens and held in great amounts also abroad, the nature of the\nsilver-coinage measure, as affecting this relation of the Government to the\nholders of the public debt, becomes an element, in any proposed\nlegislation, of the highest concern. The obligation of the public faith\ntranscends all questions of profit or public advantage otherwise. Its\nunquestionable maintenance is the dictate as well of the highest expediency\nas of the most necessary duty, and will ever be carefully guarded by\nCongress and people alike.</p>\n\n<p>The public debt of the United States to the amount of $729,000,000 bears\ninterest at the rate of 6 per cent, and $708,000,000 at the rate of 5 per\ncent, and the only way in which the country can be relieved from the\npayment of these high rates of interest is by advantageously refunding the\nindebtedness. Whether the debt is ultimately paid in gold or in silver coin\nis of but little moment compared with the possible reduction of interest\none-third by refunding it at such reduced rate. If the United States had\nthe unquestioned right to pay its bonds in silver coin, the little benefit\nfrom that process would be greatly overbalanced by the injurious effect of\nsuch payment if made or proposed against the honest convictions of the\npublic creditors.</p>\n\n<p>All the bonds that have been issued since February 12, 1873, when gold\nbecame the only unlimited legal-tender metallic currency of the country,\nare justly payable in gold coin or in coin of equal value. During the time\nof these issues the only dollar that could be or was received by the\nGovernment in exchange for bonds was the gold dollar. To require the public\ncreditors to take in repayment any dollar of less commercial value would be\nregarded by them as a repudiation of the full obligation assumed. The bonds\nissued prior to 1873 were issued at a time when the gold dollar was the\nonly coin in circulation or contemplated by either the Government or the\nholders of the bonds as the coin in which they were to be paid. It is far\nbetter to pay these bonds in that coin than to seem to take advantage of\nthe unforeseen fall in silver bullion to pay in a new issue of silver coin\nthus made so much less valuable. The power of the United States to coin\nmoney and to regulate the value thereof ought never to be exercised for the\npurpose of enabling the Government to pay its obligations in a coin of less\nvalue than that contemplated by the parties when the bonds were issued. Any\nattempt to pay the national indebtedness in a coinage of less commercial\nvalue than the money of the world would involve a violation of the public\nfaith and work irreparable injury to the public credit.</p>\n\n<p>It was the great merit of the act of March, 1869, in strengthening the\npublic credit, that it removed all doubt as to the purpose of the United\nStates to pay their bonded debt in coin. That act was accepted as a pledge\nof public faith. The Government has derived great benefit from it in the\nprogress thus far made in refunding the public debt at low rates of\ninterest. An adherence to the wise and just policy of an exact observance\nof the public faith will enable the Government rapidly to reduce the burden\nof interest on the national debt to an amount exceeding $20,000,000 per\nannum, and effect an aggregate saving to the United States of more than\n$300,000,000 before the bonds can be fully paid.</p>\n\n<p>In adapting the new silver coinage to the ordinary uses of currency in the\neveryday transactions of life and prescribing the quality of legal tender\nto be assigned to it, a consideration of the first importance should be so\nto adjust the ratio between the silver and the gold coinage, which now\nconstitutes our specie currency, as to accomplish the desired end of\nmaintaining the circulation of the two metallic currencies and keeping up\nthe volume of the two precious metals as our intrinsic money. It is a mixed\nquestion, for scientific reasoning and historical experience to determine,\nhow far and by what methods a practical equilibrium can be maintained which\nwill keep both metals in circulation in their appropriate spheres of common\nuse.</p>\n\n<p>An absolute equality of commercial value, free from disturbing\nfluctuations, is hardly attainable, and without it an unlimited legal\ntender for private transactions assigned to both metals would irresistibly\ntend to drive out of circulation the clearer coinage and disappoint the\nprincipal object proposed by the legislation in view. I apprehend,\ntherefore, that the two conditions of a near approach to equality of\ncommercial value between the gold and silver coinage of the same\ndenomination and of a limitation of the amounts for which the silver\ncoinage is to be a legal tender are essential to maintaining both in\ncirculation. If these conditions can be successfully observed, the issue\nfrom the mint of silver dollars would afford material assistance to the\ncommunity in the transition to redeemable paper money, and would facilitate\nthe resumption of specie payment and its permanent establishment. Without\nthese conditions I fear that only mischief and misfortune would flow from a\ncoinage of silver dollars with the quality of unlimited legal tender, even\nin private transactions.</p>\n\n<p>Any expectation of temporary ease from an issue of silver coinage to pass\nas a legal tender at a rate materially above its commercial value is, I am\npersuaded, a delusion. Nor can I think that there is any substantial\ndistinction between an original issue of silver dollars at a nominal value\nmaterially above their commercial value and the restoration of the silver\ndollar at a rate which once was, but has ceased to be, its commercial\nvalue. Certainly the issue of our gold coinage, reduced in weight\nmaterially below its legal-tender value, would not be any the less a\npresent debasement of the coinage by reason of its equaling, or even\nexceeding, in weight a gold coinage which at some past time had been\ncommercially equal to the legal-tender value assigned to the new issue.</p>\n\n<p>In recommending that the regulation of any silver coinage which may be\nauthorized by Congress should observe these conditions of commercial value\nand limited legal tender, I am governed by the feeling that every possible\nincrease should be given to the volume of metallic money which can be kept\nin circulation, and thereby every possible aid afforded to the people in\nthe process of resuming specie payments. It is because of my firm\nconviction that a disregard of these conditions would frustrate the good\nresults which are desired from the proposed coinage, and embarrass with new\nelements of confusion and uncertainty the business of the country, that I\nurge upon your attention these considerations.</p>\n\n<p>I respectfully recommend to Congress that in any legislation providing for\na silver coinage and imparting to it the quality of legal tender there be\nimpressed upon the measure a firm provision exempting the public debt\nheretofore issued and now outstanding from payment, either of principal or\ninterest, in any coinage of less commercial value than the present gold\ncoinage of the country.</p>\n\n<p>The organization of the civil service of the country has for a number of\nyears attracted more and more of the public attention. So general has\nbecome the opinion that the methods of admission to it and the conditions\nof remaining in it are unsound that both the great political parties have\nagreed in the most explicit declarations of the necessity of reform and in\nthe most emphatic demands for it. I have fully believed these declarations\nand demands to be the expression of a sincere conviction of the intelligent\nmasses of the people upon the subject, and that they should be recognized\nand followed by earnest and prompt action on the part of the legislative\nand executive departments of the Government, in pursuance of the purpose\nindicated.</p>\n\n<p>Before my accession to office I endeavored to have my own views distinctly\nunderstood, and upon my inauguration my accord with the public opinion was\nstated in terms believed to be plain and unambiguous. My experience in the\nexecutive duties has strongly confirmed the belief in the great advantage\nthe country would find in observing strictly the plan of the Constitution,\nwhich imposes upon the Executive the sole duty and responsibility of the\nselection of those Federal officers who by law are appointed, not elected,\nand which in like manner assigns to the Senate the complete right to advise\nand consent to or to reject the nominations so made, whilst the House of\nRepresentatives stands as the public censor of the performance of official\nduties, with the prerogative of investigation and prosecution in all cases\nof dereliction. The blemishes and imperfections in the civil service may,\nas I think, be traced in most cases to a practical confusion of the duties\nassigned to the several Departments of the Government. My purpose in this\nrespect has been to return to the system established by the fundamental\nlaw, and to do this with the heartiest cooperation and most cordial\nunderstanding with the Senate and House of Representatives.</p>\n\n<p>The practical difficulties in the selection of numerous officers for posts\nof widely varying responsibilities and duties are acknowledged to be very\ngreat. No system can be expected to secure absolute freedom from mistakes,\nand the beginning of any attempted change of custom is quite likely to be\nmore embarrassed in this respect than any subsequent period. It is here\nthat the Constitution seems to me to prove its claim to the great wisdom\naccorded to it. It gives to the Executive the assistance of the knowledge\nand experience of the Senate, which, when acting upon nominations as to\nwhich they may be disinterested and impartial judges, secures as strong a\nguaranty of freedom from errors of importance as is perhaps possible in\nhuman affairs.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to this, I recognize the public advantage of making all\nnominations, as nearly as possible, impersonal, in the sense of being free\nfrom mere caprice or favor in the selection; and in those offices in which\nspecial training is of greatly increased value I believe such a rule as to\nthe tenure of office should obtain as may induce men of proper\nqualifications to apply themselves industriously to the task of becoming\nproficients. Bearing these things in mind, I have endeavored to reduce the\nnumber of changes in subordinate places usually made upon the change of the\ngeneral administration, and shall most heartily cooperate with Congress in\nthe better systematizing of such methods and rules of admission to the\npublic service and of promotion within it as, may promise to be most\nsuccessful in making thorough competency, efficiency, and character the\ndecisive tests in these matters.</p>\n\n<p>I ask the renewed attention of Congress to what has already been done by\nthe Civil Service Commission, appointed, in pursuance of an act of\nCongress, by my predecessor, to prepare and revise civil-service rules. In\nregard to much of the departmental service, especially at Washington, it\nmay be difficult to organize a better system than that which has thus been\nprovided, and it is now being used to a considerable extent under my\ndirection. The Commission has still a legal existence, although for several\nyears no appropriation has been made for defraying its expenses. Believing\nthat this Commission has rendered valuable service and will be a most\nuseful agency in improving the administration of the civil service, I\nrespectfully recommend that a suitable appropriation, to be immediately\navailable, be made to enable it to continue its labors.</p>\n\n<p>It is my purpose to transmit to Congress as early as practicable a report\nby the chairman of the Commission, and to ask your attention to such\nmeasures on this subject as in my opinion will further promote the\nimprovement of the civil service.</p>\n\n<p>During the past year the United States have continued to maintain peaceful\nrelations with foreign powers.</p>\n\n<p>The outbreak of war between Russia and Turkey, though at one time attended\nby grave apprehension as to its effect upon other European nations, has had\nno tendency to disturb the amicable relations existing between the United\nStates and each of the two contending powers. An attitude of just and\nimpartial neutrality has been preserved, and I am gratified to state that\nin the midst of their hostilities both the Russian and the Turkish\nGovernments have shown an earnest disposition to adhere to the obligations\nof all treaties with the United States and to give due regard to the rights\nof American citizens.</p>\n\n<p>By the terms of the treaty defining the rights, immunities, and privileges\nof consuls, between Italy and the United States, ratified in 1868, either\nGovernment may, after the lapse of ten years, terminate the existence of\nthe treaty by giving twelve months\' notice of its intention. The Government\nof Italy, availing itself of this faculty, has now given the required\nnotice, and the treaty will accordingly end on the 17th of September, 1878.\nIt is understood, however, that the Italian Government wishes to renew it\nin its general scope, desiring only certain modifications in some of its\narticles. In this disposition I concur, and shall hope that no serious\nobstacles may intervene to prevent or delay the negotiation of a\nsatisfactory treaty.</p>\n\n<p>Numerous questions in regard to passports, naturalization, and exemption\nfrom military service have continued to arise in cases of emigrants from\nGermany who have returned to their native country. The provisions of the\ntreaty of February 22, 1868, however, have proved to be so ample and so\njudicious that the legation of the United States at Berlin has been able to\nadjust all claims arising under it, not only without detriment to the\namicable relations existing between the two Governments, but, it is\nbelieved, without injury or injustice to any duly naturalized American\ncitizen. It is desirable that the treaty originally made with the North\nGerman Union in 1868 should now be extended so as to apply equally to all\nthe States of the Empire of Germany.</p>\n\n<p>The invitation of the Government of France to participate in the Exposition\nof the Products of Agriculture, Industry, and the Fine Arts to be held at\nParis during the coming year was submitted for your consideration at the\nextra session. It is not doubted that its acceptance by the United States,\nand a well-selected exhibition of the products of American industry on that\noccasion, will tend to stimulate international commerce and emigration, as\nwell as to promote the traditional friendship between the two countries.</p>\n\n<p>A question arose some time since as to the proper meaning of the\nextradition articles of the treaty of 1842 between the United States and\nGreat Britain. Both Governments, however, are now in accord in the belief\nthat the question is not one that should be allowed to frustrate the ends\nof justice or to disturb the friendship between the two nations. No serious\ndifficulty has arisen in accomplishing the extradition of criminals when\nnecessary. It is probable that all points of disagreement will in due time\nbe settled, and, if need be, more explicit declarations be made in a new\ntreaty.</p>\n\n<p>The Fishery Commission under Articles XVIII to XXV of the treaty of\nWashington has concluded its session at Halifax. The result of the\ndeliberations of the commission, as made public by the commissioners, will\nbe communicated to Congress.</p>\n\n<p>A treaty for the protection of trade-marks has been negotiated with Great\nBritain, which has been submitted to the Senate for its consideration.</p>\n\n<p>The revolution which recently occurred in Mexico was followed by the\naccession of the successful party to power and the installation of its\nchief, General Porfirio Diaz, in the Presidential office. It has been the\ncustom of the United States, when such changes of government have\nheretofore occurred in Mexico, to recognize and enter into official\nrelations with the de facto government as soon as it should appear to have\nthe approval of the Mexican people and should manifest a disposition to\nadhere to the obligations of treaties and international friendship. In the\npresent case such official recognition has been deferred by the occurrences\non the Rio Grande border, the records of which have been already\ncommunicated to each House of Congress in answer to their respective\nresolutions of inquiry. Assurances have been received that the authorities\nat the seat of the Mexican Government have both the disposition and the\npower to prevent and punish such unlawful invasions and depredations. It is\nearnestly to be hoped that events may prove these assurances to be well\nrounded. The best interests of both countries require the maintenance of\npeace upon the border and the development of commerce between the two\nRepublics.</p>\n\n<p>It is gratifying to add that this temporary interruption of official\nrelations has not prevented due attention by the representatives of the\nUnited States in Mexico to the protection of American citizens, so far as\npracticable; nor has it interfered with the prompt payment of the amounts\ndue from Mexico to the United States under the treaty of July 4, 1868, and\nthe awards of the joint commission. While I do not anticipate an\ninterruption of friendly relations with Mexico, yet I can not but look with\nsome solicitude upon a continuance of border disorders as exposing the two\ncountries to initiations of popular feeling and mischances of action which\nare naturally unfavorable to complete amity. Firmly determined that nothing\nshall be wanting on my part to promote a good understanding between the two\nnations, I yet must ask the attention of Congress to the actual occurrences\non the border, that the lives and property of our citizens may be\nadequately protected and peace preserved.</p>\n\n<p>Another year has passed without bringing to a close the protracted contest\nbetween the Spanish Government and the insurrection in the island of Cuba.\nWhile the United States have sedulously abstained from any intervention in\nthis contest, it is impossible not to feel that it is attended with\nincidents affecting the rights and interests of American citizens. Apart\nfrom the effect of the hostilities upon trade between the United States and\nCuba, their progress is inevitably accompanied by complaints, having more\nor less foundation, of searches, arrests, embargoes, and oppressive taxes\nupon the property of American residents, and of unprovoked interference\nwith American vessels and commerce. It is due to the Government of Spain to\nsay that during the past year it has promptly disavowed and offered\nreparation for any unauthorized acts of unduly zealous subordinates\nwhenever such acts have been brought to its attention. Nevertheless, such\noccurrences can not but tend to excite feelings of annoyance, suspicion,\nand resentment, which are greatly to be deprecated, between the respective\nsubjects and citizens of two friendly powers.</p>\n\n<p>Much delay (consequent upon accusations of fraud in some of the awards) has\noccurred in respect to the distribution of the limited amounts received\nfrom Venezuela under the treaty of April 25, 1866, applicable to the awards\nof the joint commission created by that treaty. So long as these matters\nare pending in Congress the Executive can not assume either to pass upon\nthe questions presented or to distribute the fund received. It is eminently\ndesirable that definite legislative action should be taken, either\naffirming the awards to be final or providing some method for reexamination\nof the claims. Our relations with the Republics of Central and South\nAmerica and with the Empire of Brazil have continued without serious\nchange, further than the temporary interruption of diplomatic intercourse\nwith Venezuela and with Guatemala. Amicable relations have already been\nfully restored with Venezuela, and it is not doubted that all grounds of\nmisunderstanding with Guatemala will speedily be removed. From all these\ncountries there are favorable indications of a disposition on the part of\ntheir Governments and people to reciprocate our efforts in the direction of\nincreased commercial intercourse.</p>\n\n<p>The Government of the Samoan Islands has sent an envoy, in the person of\nits secretary of state, to invite the Government of the United States to\nrecognize and protect their independence, to establish commercial relations\nwith their people, and to assist them in their steps toward regulated and\nresponsible government. The inhabitants of these islands, having made\nconsiderable progress in Christian civilization and the development of\ntrade, are doubtful of their ability to maintain peace and independence\nwithout the aid of some stronger power. The subject is deemed worthy of\nrespectful attention, and the claims upon our assistance by this distant\ncommunity will be carefully considered.</p>\n\n<p>The long commercial depression in the United States has directed attention\nto the subject of the possible increase of our foreign trade and the\nmethods for its development, not only with Europe, but with other\ncountries, and especially with the States and sovereignties of the Western\nHemisphere. Instructions from the Department of State were issued to the\nvarious diplomatic and consular officers of the Government, asking them to\ndevote attention to the question of methods by which trade between the\nrespective countries of their official residence and the United States\ncould be most judiciously fostered. In obedience to these instructions,\nexaminations and reports upon this subject have been made by many of these\nofficers and transmitted to the Department, and the same are submitted to\nthe consideration of Congress.</p>\n\n<p>The annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury on the state of the\nfinances presents important questions for the action of Congress, upon some\nof which I have already remarked.</p>\n\n<p>The revenues of the Government during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1877,\nwere $269,000,586.62; the total expenditures for the same period were\n$238,660,008.93, leaving a surplus revenue of $30,340,577.69. This has\nsubstantially supplied the requirements of the sinking fund for that year.\nThe estimated revenues of the current fiscal year are $265,500,000, and the\nestimated expenditures for the same period are $232,430,643.72. If these\nestimates prove to be correct, there will be a surplus revenue of\n$33,069,356.28--an amount nearly sufficient for the sinking fund for that\nyear. The estimated revenues for the next fiscal year are $269,250,000. It\nappears from the report that during the last fiscal year the revenues of\nthe Government, compared with the previous year, have largely decreased.\nThis decrease, amounting to the sum of $18,481,452.54, was mainly in\ncustoms duties, caused partly by a large falling off of the amount of\nimported dutiable goods and partly by the general fall of prices in the\nmarkets of production of such articles as pay ad valorem taxes.</p>\n\n<p>While this is felt injuriously in the diminution of the revenue, it has\nbeen accompanied with a very large increase of exportations. The total\nexports during the last fiscal year, including coin, have been\n$658,637,457, and the imports have been $492,097,540, leaving a balance of\ntrade in favor of the United States amounting to the sum of $166,539,917,\nthe beneficial effects of which extend to all branches of business.</p>\n\n<p>The estimated revenue for the next fiscal year will impose upon Congress\nthe duty of strictly limiting appropriations, including the requisite sum\nfor the maintenance of the sinking fund, within the aggregate estimated\nreceipts.</p>\n\n<p>While the aggregate of taxes should not be increased, amendments might be\nmade to the revenue laws that would, without diminishing the revenue,\nrelieve the people from unnecessary burdens. A tax on tea and coffee is\nshown by the experience not only of our own country, but of other\ncountries, to be easily collected, without loss by undervaluation or fraud,\nand largely borne in the country of production. A tax of 10 cents a pound\non tea and 2 cents a pound on coffee would produce a revenue exceeding\n$12,000,000, and thus enable Congress to repeal a multitude of annoying\ntaxes yielding a revenue not exceeding that sum. The internal-revenue\nsystem grew out of the necessities of the war, and most of the legislation\nimposing taxes upon domestic products under this system has been repealed.\nBy the substitution of a tax on tea and coffee all forms of internal\ntaxation may be repealed, except that on whisky, spirits, tobacco, and\nbeer. Attention is also called to the necessity of enacting more vigorous\nlaws for the protection of the revenue and for the punishment of frauds and\nsmuggling. This can best be done by judicious provisions that will induce\nthe disclosure of attempted fraud by undervaluation and smuggling. All\nrevenue laws should be simple in their provisions and easily understood. So\nfar as practicable, the rates of taxation should be in the form of specific\nduties, and not ad valorem, requiring the judgment of experienced men to\nascertain values and exposing the revenue to the temptation of fraud.</p>\n\n<p>My attention has been called during the recess of Congress to abuses\nexisting in the collection of the customs, and strenuous efforts have been\nmade for their correction by Executive orders. The recommendations\nsubmitted to the Secretary of the Treasury by a commission appointed to\nexamine into the collection of customs duties at the port of New York\ncontain many suggestions for the modification of the customs laws, to which\nthe attention of Congress is invited.</p>\n\n<p>It is matter of congratulation that notwithstanding the severe burdens\ncaused by the war the public faith with all creditors has been preserved,\nand that as the result of this policy the public credit has continuously\nadvanced and our public securities are regarded with the highest favor in\nthe markets of the world. I trust that no act of the Government will cast a\nshadow upon its credit.</p>\n\n<p>The progress of refunding the public debt has been rapid and satisfactory.\nUnder the contract existing when I entered upon the discharge of the duties\nof my office, bonds bearing interest at the rate of 4 1/2 per cent were\nbeing rapidly sold, and within three months the aggregate sales of these\nbonds had reached the sum of $200,000,000. With my sanction the Secretary\nof the Treasury entered into a new contract for the sale of 4 per cent\nbonds, and within thirty days after the popular subscription for such bonds\nwas opened subscriptions were had amounting to $75,496,550, which were paid\nfor within ninety days after the date of subscription. By this process,\nwithin but little more than one year, the annual interest on the public\ndebt was reduced in the sum of $3,775,000.</p>\n\n<p>I recommended that suitable provision be made to enable the people to\neasily convert their savings into Government securities, as the best mode\nin which small savings may be well secured and yield a moderate interest.\nIt is an object of public policy to retain among our own people the\nsecurities of the United States. In this way our country is guarded against\ntheir sudden return from foreign countries, caused by war or other\ndisturbances beyond our limits.</p>\n\n<p>The commerce of the United States with foreign nations, and especially the\nexport of domestic productions, has of late years largely increased; but\nthe greater portion of this trade is conducted in foreign vessels. The\nimportance of enlarging our foreign trade, and especially by direct and\nspeedy interchange with countries on this continent, can not be\noverestimated; and it is a matter of great moment that our own shipping\ninterest should receive, to the utmost practical extent, the benefit of our\ncommerce with other lands. These considerations are forcibly urged by all\nthe large commercial cities of the country, and public attention is\ngenerally and wisely attracted to the solution of the problems they\npresent. It is not doubted that Congress will take them up in the broadest\nspirit of liberality and respond to the public demand by practical\nlegislation upon this important subject.</p>\n\n<p>The report of the Secretary of War shows that the Army has been actively\nemployed during the year, and has rendered very important service in\nsuppressing hostilities in the Indian country and in preserving peace and\nprotecting life and property in the interior as well as along the Mexican\nborder. A long and arduous campaign has been prosecuted, with final\ncomplete success, against a portion of the Nez Perce tribe of Indians. A\nfull account of this campaign will be found in the report of the General of\nthe Army. It will be seen that in its course several severe battles were\nfought, in which a number of gallant officers and men lost their lives. I\njoin with the Secretary of War and the General of the Army in awarding to\nthe officers and men employed in the long and toilsome pursuit and in the\nfinal capture of these Indians the honor and praise which are so justly\ntheir due.</p>\n\n<p>The very serious riots which occurred in several of the States in July last\nrendered necessary the employment of a considerable portion of the Army to\npreserve the peace and maintain order. In the States of West Virginia,\nMaryland, Pennsylvania, and Illinois these disturbances were so formidable\nas to defy the local and State authorities, and the National Executive was\ncalled upon, in the mode provided by the Constitution and laws, to furnish\nmilitary aid. I am gratified to be able to state that the troops sent in\nresponse to these calls for aid in the suppression of domestic violence\nwere able, by the influence of their presence in the disturbed regions, to\npreserve the peace and restore order without the use of force. In the\ndischarge of this delicate and important duty both officers and men acted\nwith great prudence and courage, and for their services deserve the thanks\nof the country.</p>\n\n<p>Disturbances along the Rio Grande in Texas, to which I have already\nreferred, have rendered necessary the constant employment of a military\nforce in that vicinity. A full report of all recent military operations in\nthat quarter has been transmitted to the House of Representatives in answer\nto a resolution of that body, and it will therefore not be necessary to\nenter into details. I regret to say that these lawless incursions into our\nterritory by armed bands from the Mexican side of the line, for the purpose\nof robbery, have been of frequent occurrence, and in spite of the most\nvigilant efforts of the commander of our forces the marauders have\ngenerally succeeded in escaping into Mexico with their plunder. In May last\nI gave orders for the exercise of the utmost vigilance on the part of our\ntroops for the suppression of these raids and the punishment of the guilty\nparties, as well as the recapture of property stolen by them. General Ord,\ncommanding in Texas, was directed to invite the cooperation of the Mexican\nauthorities in efforts to this end, and to assure them that I was anxious\nto avoid giving the least offense to Mexico. At the same time, he was\ndirected to give notice of my determination to put an end to the invasion\nof our territory by lawless bands intent upon the plunder of our peaceful\ncitizens, even if the effectual punishment of the outlaws should make the\ncrossing of the border by our troops in their pursuit necessary. It is\nbelieved that this policy has had the effect to check somewhat these\ndepredations, and that with a considerable increase of our force upon that\nfrontier and the establishment of several additional military posts along\nthe Rio Grande, so as more effectually to guard that extensive border,\npeace may be preserved and the lives and property of our citizens in Texas\nfully protected.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to the 1st day of July last the Army was, in accordance with law,\nreduced to the maximum of 25,000 enlisted men, being a reduction of 2,500\nbelow the force previously authorized. This reduction was made, as required\nby law, entirely from the infantry and artillery branches of the service,\nwithout any reduction of the cavalry. Under the law as it now stands it is\nnecessary that the cavalry regiments be recruited to 100 men in each\ncompany for service on the Mexican and Indian frontiers. The necessary\neffect of this legislation is to reduce the infantry and artillery arms of\nthe service below the number required for efficiency, and I concur with the\nSecretary of War in recommending that authority be given to recruit all\ncompanies of infantry to at least 50 men and all batteries of artillery to\nat least 75 men, with the power, in case of emergency, to increase the\nformer to 100 and the latter to 122 men each.</p>\n\n<p>I invite your special attention to the following recommendations of the\nSecretary of War:</p>\n\n<p>First. That provision be made for supplying to the Army a more abundant and\nbetter supply of reading matter.</p>\n\n<p>Second. That early action be taken by Congress looking to a complete\nrevision and republication of the Army Regulations.</p>\n\n<p>Third. That section 1258 of the Revised Statutes, limiting the number of\nofficers on the retired list, be repealed.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth. That the claims arising under the act of July 4, 1864, for supplies\ntaken by the Army during the war, be taken from the offices of the\nQuartermaster and Commissary Generals and transferred to the Southern\nClaims Commission, or some other tribunal having more time and better\nfacilities for their prompt investigation and decision than are possessed\nby these officers.</p>\n\n<p>Fifth. That Congress provide for an annuity fund for the families of\ndeceased soldiers, as recommended by the paymaster-General of the Army.</p>\n\n<p>The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows that we have six squadrons\nnow engaged in the protection of our foreign commerce and other duties\npertaining to the naval service. The condition and operations of the\nDepartment are also shown. The total expenditures for the fiscal year\nending June 30, 1877, were $16,077,974.54. There are unpaid claims against\nthe Department chargeable to the last year, which are presented to the\nconsideration of Congress by the report of the Secretary. The estimates for\nthe fiscal year commencing July 1, 1878, are $16,233,234.40, exclusive of\nthe sum of $2,314,231 submitted for new buildings, repairs, and\nimprovements at the several navy-yards. The appropriations for the present\nfiscal year, commencing July 1, 1877, are $13,592,932.90. The amount drawn\nfrom the Treasury from July 1 to November 1, 1877, is $5,343,037.40, of\nwhich there is estimated to be yet available $1,029,528.30, showing the\namount of actual expenditure during the first four months of the present\nfiscal year to have been $4,313,509.10.</p>\n\n<p>The report of the Postmaster-General contains a full and clear statement of\nthe operations and condition of the Post-Office Department. The ordinary\nrevenues of the Department for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1877,\nincluding receipts from the money-order business and from official stamps\nand stamped envelopes, amounted to the sum of $27,531,585.26. The\nadditional sum of $7,013,000 was realized from appropriations from the\ngeneral Treasury for various purposes, making the receipts from all sources\n$34,544,885.26. The total expenditures during the fiscal year amounted to\n$33,486,322.44, leaving an excess of total receipts over total expenditures\nof $1,058,562.82, and an excess of total expenditures over ordinary\nreceipts of $5,954,737.18. Deducting from the total receipts the sum of\n$63,261.84, received from international money orders of the preceding\nfiscal year, and deducting from the total expenditures the sum of\n$1,163,818.20, paid on liabilities incurred in previous fiscal years, the\nexpenditures and receipts appertaining to the business of the last fiscal\nyear were as follows:</p>\n\n<p>Expenditures - $32,322,504.24</p>\n\n<p>Receipts (ordinary, from money-order business and\nfrom official postage stamps) - 27,468,323,420 -\n</p>\n\t\t\t<div class="textNav"><a href="#top">^ Return to top</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>\n\t<div id="footer"><strong><em>State of the Union</em></strong> is a project\n\t\tby Brad Borevitz at <a href="http://www.onetwothree.net">onetwothree.net</a></div>\n</div>\n<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">\n</script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n_uacct = "UA-410742-1";\nurchinTracker();\n</script>\n</body>\n<!-- InstanceEnd -->\n</html>\n'
