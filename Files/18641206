While our political\nrelations with that country have undergone no change, we have at the\nsame time strictly maintained neutrality between the belligerents.</p>\n\n<p>At the request of the States of Costa Rica and Nicaragua, a competent\nengineer has been authorized to make a survey of the river San Juan and\nthe port of San Juan. It is a source of much satisfaction that the\ndifficulties which for a moment excited some political apprehensions\nand caused a closing of the interoceanic transit route have been\namicably adjusted, and that there is a good prospect that the route\nwill soon be reopened with an increase of capacity and adaptation. We\ncould not exaggerate either the commercial or the political importance\nof that great improvement.</p>\n\n<p>It would be doing injustice to an important South American State not to\nacknowledge the directness, frankness, and cordiality with which the\nUnited States of Colombia have entered into intimate relations with\nthis Government. A claims convention has been constituted to complete\nthe unfinished work of the one which closed its session in 1861.</p>\n\n<p>The new liberal constitution of Venezuela having gone into effect with\nthe universal acquiescence of the people, the Government under it has\nbeen recognized and diplomatic intercourse with it has opened in a\ncordial and friendly spirit. The long-deferred Aves Island claim has\nbeen satisfactorily paid and discharged.</p>\n\n<p>Mutual payments have been made of the claims awarded by the late joint\ncommission for the settlement of claims between the United States and\nPeru. An earnest and cordial friendship continues to exist between the\ntwo countries, and such efforts as were in my power have been used to\nremove misunderstanding and avert a threatened war between Peru and\nSpain.</p>\n\n<p>Our relations are of the most friendly nature with Chile, the Argentine\nRepublic, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Paraguay, San Salvador, and Hayti.\nDuring the past year no differences of any kind have arisen with any of\nthose Republics, and, on the other hand, their sympathies with the\nUnited States are constantly expressed with cordiality and earnestness.</p>\n\n<p>The claim arising from the seizure of the cargo of the brig Macedonian\nin 1821 has been paid in full by the Government of Chile. Civil war\ncontinues in the Spanish part of San Domingo, apparently without\nprospect of an early close.</p>\n\n<p>Official correspondence has been freely opened with Liberia, and it\ngives us a pleasing view of social and political progress in that\nRepublic. It may be expected to derive new vigor from American\ninfluence, improved by the rapid disappearance of slavery in the United\nStates.</p>\n\n<p>I solicit your authority to furnish to the Republic a gunboat at\nmoderate cost, to be reimbursed to the United States by installments.\nSuch a vessel is needed for the safety of that State against the native\nAfrican races, and in Liberian hands it would be more effective in\narresting the African slave trade than a squadron in our own hands. The\npossession of the least organized naval force would stimulate a\ngenerous ambition in the Republic, and the confidence which we should\nmanifest by furnishing it would win forbearance and favor toward the\ncolony from all civilized nations.</p>\n\n<p>The proposed overland telegraph between America and Europe, by the way\nof Behrings Straits and Asiatic Russia, which was sanctioned by\nCongress at the last session, has been undertaken, under very favorable\ncircumstances, by an association of American citizens, with the cordial\ngood will and support as well of this Government as of those of Great\nBritain and Russia. Assurances have been received from most of the\nSouth American States of their high appreciation of the enterprise and\ntheir readiness to cooperate in constructing lines tributary to that\nworld-encircling communication. I learn with much satisfaction that the\nnoble design of a telegraphic communication between the eastern coast\nof America and Great Britain has been renewed, with full expectation of\nits early accomplishment.</p>\n\n<p>Thus it is hoped that with the return of domestic peace the country\nwill be able to resume with energy and advantage its former high career\nof commerce and civilization.</p>\n\n<p>Our very popular and estimable representative in Egypt died in April\nlast. An unpleasant altercation which arose between the temporary\nincumbent of the office and the Government of the Pasha resulted in a\nsuspension of intercourse. The evil was promptly corrected on the\narrival of the successor in the consulate, and our relations with\nEgypt, as well as our relations with the Barbary Powers, are entirely\nsatisfactory.</p>\n\n<p>The rebellion which has so long been flagrant in China has at last been\nsuppressed, with the cooperating good offices of this Government and of\nthe other Western commercial States. The judicial consular\nestablishment there has become very difficult and onerous, and it will\nneed legislative revision to adapt it to the extension of our commerce\nand to the more intimate intercourse which has been instituted with the\nGovernment and people of that vast Empire. China seems to be accepting\nwith hearty good will the conventional laws which regulate commercial\nand social intercourse among the Western nations.</p>\n\n<p>Owing to the peculiar situation of Japan and the anomalous form of its\nGovernment, the action of that Empire in performing treaty stipulations\nis inconstant and capricious. Nevertheless, good progress has been\neffected by the Western powers, moving with enlightened concert. Our\nown pecuniary claims have been allowed or put in course of settlement,\nand the inland sea has been reopened to commerce. There is reason also\nto believe that these proceedings have increased rather than diminished\nthe friendship of Japan toward the United States.</p>\n\n<p>The ports of Norfolk, Fernandina, and Pensacola have been opened by\nproclamation. It is hoped that foreign merchants will now consider\nwhether it is not safer and more profitable to themselves, as well as\njust to the United States, to resort to these and other open ports than\nit is to pursue, through many hazards and at vast cost, a contraband\ntrade with other ports which are closed, if not by actual military\noccupation, at least by a lawful and effective blockade.</p>\n\n<p>For myself, I have no doubt of the power and duty of the Executive,\nunder the law of nations, to exclude enemies of the human race from an\nasylum in the United States. If Congress should think that proceedings\nin such cases lack the authority of law, or ought to be further\nregulated by it, I recommend that provision be made for effectually\npreventing foreign slave traders from acquiring domicile and facilities\nfor their criminal occupation in our country.</p>\n\n<p>It is possible that if it were new and open question the maritime\npowers, with the lights they now enjoy, would not concede the\nprivileges of a naval belligerent to the insurgents of the United\nStates, destitute, as they are, and always have been, equally of ships\nof war and of ports and harbors. Disloyal emissaries have been neither\nless assiduous nor more successful during the last year than they were\nbefore that time in their efforts under favor of that privilege, to\nembroil our country in foreign wars. The desire and determination of\nthe governments of the maritime states to defeat that design are\nbelieved to be as sincere as and can not be more earnest than our own.\nNevertheless, unforeseen political difficulties have arisen, especially\nin Brazilian and British ports and on the northern boundary of the\nUnited States, which have required, and are likely to continue to\nrequire, the practice of constant vigilance and a just and conciliatory\nspirit on the part of the United States, as well as of the nations\nconcerned and their governments.</p>\n\n<p>Commissioners have been appointed under the treaty with Great Britain\non the adjustment of the claims of the Hudsons Bay and Pugets Sound\nAgricultural Companies, in Oregon, and are now proceeding to the\nexecution of the trust assigned to them.</p>\n\n<p>In view of the insecurity of life and property in the region adjacent\nto the Canadian border, by reason of recent assaults and depredations\ncommitted by inimical and desperate persons who are harbored there, it\nhas been thought proper to give notice that after the expiration of six\nmonths, the period conditionally stipulated in the existing arrangement\nwith Great Britain, the United States must hold themselves at liberty\nto increase their naval armament upon the Lakes if they shall find that\nproceeding necessary. The condition of the border will necessarily come\ninto consideration in connection with the question of continuing or\nmodifying the rights of transit from Canada through the United States,\nas well as the regulation of imposts, which were temporarily\nestablished by the reciprocity treaty of the 5th June, 1854.</p>\n\n<p>I desire, however, to be understood while making this statement that\nthe colonial authorities of Canada are not deemed to be intentionally\nunjust or unfriendly toward the United States, but, on the contrary,\nthere is every reason to expect that, with the approval of the Imperial\nGovernment, they will take the necessary measures to prevent new\nincursions across the border.</p>\n\n<p>The act passed at the last session for the encouragement of immigration\nhas so far as was possible been put into operation. It seems to need\namendment which will enable the officers of the Government to prevent\nthe practice of frauds against the immigrants while on their way and on\ntheir arrival in the ports, so as to secure them here a free choice of\navocations and places of settlement. A liberal disposition toward this\ngreat national policy is manifested by most of the European States, and\nought to be reciprocated on our part by giving the immigrants effective\nnational protection. I regard our immigrants as one of the principal\nreplenishing streams which are appointed by Providence to repair the\nravages of internal war and its wastes of national strength and health.\nAll that is necessary is to secure the flow of that stream in its\npresent fullness, and to that end the Government must in every way make\nit manifest that it neither needs nor designs to impose involuntary\nmilitary service upon those who come from other lands to cast their lot\nin our country.</p>\n\n<p>The financial affairs of the Government have been successfully\nadministered during the last year. The legislation of the last session\nof Congress has beneficially affected the revenues, although sufficient\ntime has not yet elapsed to experience the full effect of several of\nthe provisions of the acts of Congress imposing increased taxation.</p>\n\n<p>The receipts during the year from all sources, upon the basis of\nwarrants signed by the Secretary of the Treasury, including loans and\nthe balance in the Treasury on the 1st day of July, 1863, were\n$1,394,796,007.62, and the aggregate disbursements, upon the same\nbasis, were $1,298,056,101.89, leaving a balance in the Treasury, as\nshown by warrants, of $96,739,905.73.</p>\n\n<p>Deduct from these amounts the amount of the principal of the public\ndebt redeemed and the amount of issues in substitution therefor, and\nthe actual cash operations of the Treasury were: Receipts,\n$884,076,646.57; disbursements, $865,234,087.86; which leaves a cash\nbalance in the Treasury of $18,842,558.71.</p>\n\n<p>Of the receipts there were derived from customs $102,316,152.99, from\nlands $588,333.29. from direct taxes $475,648.96, from internal revenue\n$109,741,134.10, from miscellaneous sources $47,511,448.10, and from\nloans applied to actual expenditures, including former balance,\n$623,443,929.13.</p>\n\n<p>There were disbursed for the civil service $27,505,599.46, for pensions\nand Indians $7,517,930.97, for the War Department $690,791,842.97, for\nthe Navy Department $85,733,292.77, for interest on the public debt\n$53,685,421.69, making an aggregate of $865,234,087.86 and leaving a\nbalance in the Treasury of $18,842,558.71, as before stated.</p>\n\n<p>For the actual receipts and disbursements for the first quarter and the\nestimated receipts and disbursements for the three remaining quarters\nof the current fiscal year, and the general operations of the Treasury\nin detail, I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury.\nI concur with him in the opinion that the proportion of moneys required\nto meet the expenses consequent upon the war derived from taxation\nshould be still further increased; and I earnestly invite your\nattention to this subject, to the end that there may be such additional\nlegislation as shall be required to meet the just expectations of the\nSecretary.</p>\n\n<p>The public debt on the 1st day of July last, as appears by the books of\nthe Treasury, amounted to $1,740,690,489.49. Probably, should the war\ncontinue for another year, that amount may be increased by not far from\nfive hundred millions. Held, as it is, for the most part by our own\npeople, it has become a substantial branch of national, though private,\nproperty. For obvious reasons the more nearly this property can be\ndistributed among all the people the better. To favor such general\ndistribution, greater inducements to become owners might, perhaps, with\ngood effect and without injury be presented to persons of limited\nmeans. With this view I suggest whether it might not be both competent\nand expedient for Congress to provide that a limited amount of some\nfuture issue of public securities might be held by any bona fide\npurchaser exempt from taxation and from seizure for debt, under such\nrestrictions and limitations as might be necessary to guard against\nabuse of so important a privilege. This would enable every prudent\nperson to set aside a small annuity against a possible day of want.</p>\n\n<p>Privileges like these would render the possession of such securities to\nthe amount limited most desirable to every person of small means who\nmight be able to save enough for the purpose. The great advantage of\ncitizens being creditors as well as debtors with relation to the public\ndebt is obvious. Men readily perceive that they can not be much\noppressed by a debt which they owe to themselves.</p>\n\n<p>The public debt on the 1st day of July last, although somewhat\nexceeding the estimate of the Secretary of the Treasury made to\nCongress at the commencement of the last session, falls short of the\nestimate of that officer made in the preceding December as to its\nprobable amount at the beginning of this year by the sum of\n$3,995,097.31. This fact exhibits a satisfactory condition and conduct\nof the operations of the Treasury.</p>\n\n<p>The national banking system is proving to be acceptable to capitalists\nand to the people. On the 25th day of November 584 national banks had\nbeen organized, a considerable number of which were conversions from\nState banks. Changes from State systems to the national system are\nrapidly taking place, and it is hoped that very soon there will be in\nthe United States no banks of issue not authorized by Congress and no\nbank-note circulation not secured by the Government. That the\nGovernment and the people will derive great benefit from this change in\nthe banking systems of the country can hardly be questioned. The\nnational system will create a reliable and permanent influence in\nsupport of the national credit and protect the people against losses in\nthe use of paper money. Whether or not any further legislation is\nadvisable for the suppression of State-bank issues it will be for\nCongress to determine. It seems quite clear that the Treasury can not\nbe satisfactorily conducted unless the Government can exercise a\nrestraining power over the bank-note circulation of the country. The\nreport of the Secretary of War and the accompanying documents will\ndetail the campaigns of the armies in the field since the date of the\nlast annual message, and also the operations of the several\nadministrative bureaus of the War Department during the last year. It\nwill also specify the measures deemed essential for the national\ndefense and to keep up and supply the requisite military force.</p>\n\n<p>The report of the Secretary of the Navy presents a comprehensive and\nsatisfactory exhibit of the affairs of that Department and of the naval\nservice. It is a subject of congratulation and laudable pride to our\ncountrymen that a Navy of such vast proportions has been organized in\nso brief a period and conducted with so much efficiency and success.</p>\n\n<p>The general exhibit of the Navy, including vessels under construction\non the 1st of December, 1864, shows a total of 671 vessels, carrying\n4,610 guns, and of 510,396 tons, being an actual increase during the\nyear, over and above all losses by shipwreck or in battle, of 83\nvessels, 167 guns, and 42,427 tons.</p>\n\n<p>The total number of men at this time in the naval service, including\nofficers, is about 51,000.</p>\n\n<p>There have been captured by the Navy during the year 324 vessels, and\nthe whole number of naval captures since hostilities commenced is\n1,379, of which 267 are steamers.</p>\n\n<p>The gross proceeds arising from the sale of condemned prize property\nthus far reported amount to $14,396,250.51. A large amount of such\nproceeds is still under adjudication and yet to be reported.</p>\n\n<p>The total expenditure of the Navy Department of every description,\nincluding the cost of the immense squadrons that have been called into\nexistence from the 4th of March, 1861, to the 1st of November, 1864, is\n$238,647,262.35.</p>\n\n<p>Your favorable consideration is invited to the various recommendations\nof the Secretary of the Navy, especially in regard to a navy-yard and\nsuitable establishment for the construction and repair of iron vessels\nand the machinery and armature for our ships, to which reference was\nmade in my last annual message.</p>\n\n<p>Your attention is also invited to the views expressed in the report in\nrelation to the legislation of Congress at its last session in respect\nto prize on our inland waters.</p>\n\n<p>I cordially concur in the recommendation of the Secretary as to the\npropriety of creating the new rank of vice-admiral in our naval\nservice. Your attention is invited to the report of the\nPostmaster-General for a detailed account of the operations and\nfinancial condition of the Post-Office Department.</p>\n\n<p>The postal revenues for the year ending June 30, 1864, amounted to\n$12,438,253.78 and the expenditures to $12,644,786.20, the excess of\nexpenditures over receipts being $206,652.42.</p>\n\n<p>The views presented by the Postmaster-General on the subject of special\ngrants by the Government in aid of the establishment of new lines of\nocean mail steamships and the policy he recommends for the development\nof increased commercial intercourse with adjacent and neighboring\ncountries should receive the careful consideration of Congress.</p>\n\n<p>It is of noteworthy interest that the steady expansion of population,\nimprovement, and governmental institutions over the new and unoccupied\nportions of our country have scarcely been checked, much less impeded\nor destroyed, by our great civil war, which at first glance would seem\nto have absorbed almost the entire energies of the nation.</p>\n\n<p>The organization and admission of the State of Nevada has been\ncompleted in conformity with law, and thus our excellent system is\nfirmly established in the mountains, which once seemed a barren and\nuninhabitable waste between the Atlantic States and those which have\ngrown up on the coast of the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n\n<p>The Territories of the Union are generally in a condition of prosperity\nand rapid growth. Idaho and Montana, by reason of their great distance\nand the interruption of communication with them by Indian hostilities,\nhave been only partially organized; but it is understood that these\ndifficulties are about to disappear, which will permit their\ngovernments, like those of the others, to go into speedy and full\noperation. As intimately connected with and promotive of this material\ngrowth of the nation, I ask the attention of Congress to the valuable\ninformation and important recommendations relating to the public lands,\nIndian affairs, the Pacific Railroad, and mineral discoveries contained\nin the report of the Secretary of the Interior which is herewith\ntransmitted, and which report also embraces the subjects of patents,\npensions, and other topics of public interest pertaining to his\nDepartment.</p>\n\n<p>The quantity of public land disposed of during the five quarters ending\non the 30th of September last was 4,221,342 acres, of which 1,538,614\nacres were entered under the homestead law. The remainder was located\nwith military land warrants, agricultural scrip certified to States for\nrailroads, and sold for cash. The cash received from sales and location\nfees was $1,019,446.</p>\n\n<p>The income from sales during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1864, was\n$678,007.21, against $136,077.95 received during the preceding year.\nThe aggregate number of acres surveyed during the year has been equal\nto the quantity disposed of, and there is open to settlement about\n133,000,000 acres of surveyed land.</p>\n\n<p>The great enterprise of connecting the Atlantic with the Pacific States\nby railways and telegraph lines has been entered upon with a vigor that\ngives assurance of success, notwithstanding the embarrassments arising\nfrom the prevailing high prices of materials and labor. The route of\nthe main line of the road has been definitely located for 100 miles\nwestward from the initial point at Omaha City, Nebr., and a preliminary\nlocation of the Pacific Railroad of California has been made from\nSacramento eastward to the great bend of the Truckee River in Nevada.\nNumerous discoveries of gold, silver, and cinnabar mines have been\nadded to the many heretofore known, and the country occupied by the\nSierra Nevada and Rocky mountains and the subordinate ranges now teems\nwith enterprising labor, which is richly remunerative. It is believed\nthat the product of the mines of precious metals in that region has\nduring the year reached, if not exceeded, one hundred millions in\nvalue.</p>\n\n<p>It was recommended in my last annual message that our Indian system be\nremodeled. Congress at its last session, acting upon the\nrecommendation, did provide for reorganizing the system in California,\nand it is believed that under the present organization the management\nof the Indians there will be attended with reasonable success. Much yet\nremains to be done to provide for the proper government of the Indians\nin other parts of the country, to render it secure for the advancing\nset-tier, and to provide for the welfare of the Indian. The Secretary\nreiterates his recommendations, and to them the attention of Congress\nis invited.</p>\n\n<p>The liberal provisions made by Congress for paying pensions to invalid\nsoldiers and sailors of the Republic and to the widows, orphans, and\ndependent mothers of those who have fallen in battle or died of disease\ncontracted or of wounds received in the service of their country have\nbeen diligently administered. There have been added to the pension\nrolls during the year ending the 30th day of June last the names of\n16,770 invalid soldiers and of 271 disabled seamen, making the present\nnumber of army invalid pensioners 22,767 and of navy invalid pensioners\n712.</p>\n\n<p>Of widows, orphans, and mothers 22,198 have been placed on the army\npension rolls and 248 on the navy rolls. The present number of army\npensioners of this class is 25,433 and of navy pensioners 793. At the\nbeginning of the year the number of Revolutionary pensioners was 1,430.\nOnly 12 of them were soldiers, of whom 7 have since died. The remainder\nare those who under the law receive pensions because of relationship to\nRevolutionary soldiers. During the year ending the 30th of June, 1864,\n$4,504,616.92 have been paid to pensioners of all classes.</p>\n\n<p>I cheerfully commend to your continued patronage the benevolent\ninstitutions of the District of Columbia which have hitherto been\nestablished or fostered by Congress, and respectfully refer for\ninformation concerning them and in relation to the Washington Aqueduct,\nthe Capitol, and other matters of local interest to the report of the\nSecretary.</p>\n\n<p>The Agricultural Department, under the supervision of its present\nenergetic and faithful head, is rapidly commending itself to the great\nand vital interest it was created to advance It is peculiarly the\npeople\'s Department, in which they feel more directly concerned than in\nany other. I commend it to the continued attention and fostering care\nof Congress.</p>\n\n<p>The war continues. Since the last annual message all the important\nlines and positions then occupied by our forces have been maintained\nand our arms have steadily advanced, thus liberating the regions left\nin rear, so that Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and parts of other\nStates have again produced reasonably fair crops.</p>\n\n<p>The most remarkable feature in the military operations of the year is\nGeneral Sherman\'s attempted march of 300 miles directly through the\ninsurgent region. It tends to show a great increase of our relative\nstrength that our General in Chief should feel able to confront and\nhold in check every active force of the enemy, and yet to detach a\nwell-appointed large army to move on such an expedition. The result not\nyet being known, conjecture in regard to it is not here indulged.</p>\n\n<p>Important movements have also occurred during the year to the effect of\nmolding society for durability in the Union. Although short of complete\nsuccess, it is much in the fight direction that 12,000 citizens in each\nof the States of Arkansas and Louisiana have organized loyal State\ngovernments, with free constitutions, and are earnestly struggling to\nmaintain and administer them. The movements in the same direction, more\nextensive though less definite, in Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennessee\nshould not be overlooked. But Maryland presents the example of complete\nsuccess. Maryland is secure to liberty and union for all the future.\nThe genius of rebellion will no more claim Maryland. Like another foul\nspirit being driven out, it may seek to tear her, but it will woo her\nno-more.</p>\n\n<p>At the last session of Congress a proposed amendment of the\nConstitution abolishing slavery throughout the United States passed the\nSenate, but failed for lack of the requisite two-thirds vote in the\nHouse of Representatives. Although the present is the same Congress and\nnearly the same members, and without questioning the wisdom or\npatriotism of those who stood in opposition, I venture to recommend the\nreconsideration and passage of the measure at the present session. Of\ncourse the abstract question is not changed; but in intervening\nelection shows almost certainly that the next Congress will pass the\nmeasure if this does not. Hence there is only a question of time as to\nwhen the proposed amendment will go to the States for their action. And\nas it is to so go at all events, may we not agree that the sooner the\nbetter? It is not claimed that the election has imposed a duty on\nmembers to change their views or their votes any further than, as an\nadditional element to be considered, their judgment may be affected by\nit. It is the voice of the people now for the first time heard upon the\nquestion. In a great national crisis like ours unanimity of action\namong those seeking a common end is very desirable--almost\nindispensable. And yet no approach to such unanimity is attainable\nunless some deference shall be paid to the will of the majority simply\nbecause it is the will of the majority. In this case the common end is\nthe maintenance of the Union, and among the means to secure that end\nsuch will, through the election, is most dearly declared in favor of\nsuch constitutional amendment.</p>\n\n<p>The most reliable indication of public purpose in this country is\nderived through our popular elections. Judging by the recent canvass\nand its result, the purpose of the people within the loyal States to\nmaintain the integrity of the Union was never more firm nor more nearly\nunanimous than now. The extraordinary calmness and good order with\nwhich the millions of voters met and mingled at the polls give strong\nassurance of this. Not only all those who supported the Union ticket,\nso called, but a great majority of the opposing party also may be\nfairly claimed to entertain and to be actuated by the same purpose. It\nis an unanswerable argument to this effect that no candidate for any\noffice whatever, high or low, has ventured to seek votes on the avowal\nthat he was for giving up the Union. There have been much impugning of\nmotives and much heated controversy as to the proper means and best\nmode of advancing the Union cause, but on the distinct issue of Union\nor no Union the politicians have shown their instinctive knowledge that\nthere is no diversity among the people. In affording the people the\nfair opportunity of showing one to another and to the world this\nfirmness and unanimity of purpose, the election has been of vast value\nto the national cause.</p>\n\n<p>The election has exhibited another tact not less valuable to be\nknown--the fact that we do not approach exhaustion in the most\nimportant branch of national resources, that of living men. While it is\nmelancholy to reflect that the war has filled so many graves and\ncarried mourning to so many hearts, it is some relief to know that,\ncompared with the surviving, the fallen have been so few. While corps\nand divisions and brigades and regiments have formed and fought and\ndwindled and gone out of existence, a great majority of the men who\ncomposed them are still living. The same is true of the naval service.\nThe election returns prove this. So many voters could not else be\nfound. The States regularly holding elections, both now and four years\nago, to wit, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana,\nIowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota,\nMissouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon,\nPennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin, east\n3,982,011 votes now, against 3,870,222 cast then, showing an aggregate\nnow of 3,982,011. To this is to be added 33,762 cast now in the new\nStates of Kansas and Nevada, which States did not vote in 1860, thus\nswelling the aggregate to 4,015,773 and the net increase during the\nthree years and a half of war to 145,551. A table is appended showing\nparticulars. To this again should be added the number of all soldiers\nin the field from Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware,\nIndiana, Illinois, and California, who by the laws of those States\ncould not vote away from their homes, and which number can not be less\nthan 90,000. Nor yet is this all. The number in organized Territories\nis triple now what it was four years ago, while thousands, white and\nblack, join us as the national arms press back the insurgent lines. So\nmuch is shown, affirmatively and negatively, by the election. It is not\nmaterial to inquire how the increase has been produced or to show that\nit would have been greater but for the war, which is probably true. The\nimportant fact remains demonstrated that we have more men now than we\nhad when the war began; that we are not exhausted nor in process of\nexhaustion; that we are gaining strength and may if need be maintain\nthe contest indefinitely. This as to men. Material resources are now\nmore complete and abundant than ever.</p>\n\n<p>The national resources, then, are unexhausted, and, as we believe,\ninexhaustible. The public purpose to reestablish and maintain the\nnational authority is unchanged, and, as we believe, unchangeable. The\nmanner of continuing the effort remains to choose. On careful\nconsideration of all the evidence accessible it seems to me that no\nattempt at negotiation with the insurgent leader could result in any\ngood. He would accept nothing short of severance of the Union,\nprecisely what we will not and can not give. His declarations to this\neffect are explicit and oft repeated. He does not attempt to deceive\nus. He affords us no excuse to deceive ourselves. He can not\nvoluntarily reaccept the Union; we can not voluntarily yield it.\nBetween him and us the issue is distinct, simple, and inflexible. It is\nan issue which can only be tried by war and decided by victory. If we\nyield, we are beaten; if the Southern people fail him, he is beaten.\nEither way it would be the victory and defeat following war. What is\ntrue, however, of him who heads the insurgent cause is not necessarily\ntrue of those who follow. Although he can not reaccept the Union, they\ncan. Some of them, we know, already desire peace and reunion. The\nnumber of such may increase. They can at any moment have peace simply\nby laying down their arms and submitting to the national authority\nunder the Constitution. Alter so much the Government could not, if it\nwould, maintain war against them. The loyal people would not sustain or\nallow it. If questions should remain, we would adjust them by the\npeaceful means of legislation, conference, courts, and votes, operating\nonly in constitutional and lawful channels. Some certain, and other\npossible, questions are and would be beyond the Executive power to\nadjust; as, for instance, the admission of members into Congress and\nwhatever might require the appropriation of money. The Executive power\nitself would be greatly diminished by the cessation of actual war.\nPardons and remissions of forfeitures, however, would still be within\nExecutive control. In what spirit and temper this control would be\nexercised can be fairly judged of by the past.</p>\n\n<p>A year ago general pardon and amnesty, upon specified terms, were\noffered to all except certain designated classes, and it was at the\nsame time made known that the excepted classes were still within\ncontemplation of special clemency. During the year many availed\nthemselves of the general provision, and many more would, only that the\nsigns of bad faith in some led to such precautionary measures as\nrendered the practical process less easy and certain. During the same\ntime also special pardons have been granted to individuals of the\nexcepted classes, and no voluntary application has been denied. Thus\npractically the door has been for a full year open to all except such\nas were not in condition to make free choice; that is, such as were in\ncustody or under constraint. It is still so open to all. But the time\nmay come, probably will come, when public duty shall demand that it be\nclosed and that in lieu more rigorous measures than heretofore shall be\nadopted. In presenting the abandonment of armed resistance to the\nnational authority on the part of the insurgents as the only\nindispensable condition to ending the war on the part of the\nGovernment, I retract nothing heretofore said as to slavery. I repeat\nthe declaration made a year a ago, that "while I remain in my present\nposition I shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipation\nproclamation, nor shall I return to slavery any person who is free by\nthe terms of that proclamation or by any of the acts of Congress." If\nthe people should, by whatever mode or means, make it an Executive duty\nto re-enslave such persons, another, and not I, must be their\ninstrument to perform it. In stating a single condition of peace I mean\nsimply to say that the war will cease on the part of the Government\nwhenever it shall have ceased on the part of those who began it.</p>\n\n<p>State - 1860 - 1864</p>\n\n<p>California - 118,840 - 110,000</p>\n\n<p>Connecticut - 77,246 - 86,616</p>\n\n<p>Delaware - 16,039 - 16,924</p>\n\n<p>Illinois - 339,693 - 348,235</p>\n\n<p>Indiana - 272,143 - 280,645</p>\n\n<p>Iowa - 128,331 - 143,331</p>\n\n<p>Kentucky - 146,216 - 91,300</p>\n\n<p>Maine - 97,918 - 115,141</p>\n\n<p>Maryland - 92,502 - 72,703</p>\n\n<p>Massachusetts - 169,533 - 175,487</p>\n\n<p>Michigan - 154,747 - 162,413</p>\n\n<p>Minnesota - 34,799 - 42,534</p>\n\n<p>Missouri - 165,538 - 90,000</p>\n\n<p>New Hampshire - 65,953 - 69,111</p>\n\n<p>New Jersey - 121,125 - 128,680</p>\n\n<p>New York - 675,156 - 730,664</p>\n\n<p>Ohio - 42,441 - 470,745</p>\n\n<p>Oregon - 14,410 - 14,410+</p>\n\n<p>Pennsylvania - 476,442 - 572,697</p>\n\n<p>Rhode Island - 19,931 - 22,187</p>\n\n<p>Vermont - 42,844 - 55,811</p>\n\n<p>West Virginia - 46,195 - 33,874</p>\n\n<p>Wisconsin - 152,180 - 148,513 -\n</p>\n\t\t\t<div class="textNav"><a href="#top">^ Return to top</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>\n\t<div id="footer"><strong><em>State of the Union</em></strong> is a project\n\t\tby Brad Borevitz at <a href="http://www.onetwothree.net">onetwothree.net</a></div>\n</div>\n<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">\n</script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n_uacct = "UA-410742-1";\nurchinTracker();\n</script>\n</body>\n<!-- InstanceEnd -->\n</html>\n'
