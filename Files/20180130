Trump</h2>\n\t\t\t<h3>January 30, 2018</h3>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p>\nMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of\nthe United States, and my fellow Americans:</p>\n\n<p>Less than 1 year has passed since I first stood at this podium, in this\nmajestic chamber, to speak on behalf of the American People -- and to\naddress their concerns, their hopes, and their dreams. That night, our\nnew Administration had already taken swift action. A new tide of\noptimism was already sweeping across our land.</p>\n\n<p>Each day since, we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous\nmission -- to make America great again for all Americans.</p>\n\n<p>Over the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieved\nextraordinary success. We have faced challenges we expected, and others\nwe could never have imagined. We have shared in the heights of victory\nand the pains of hardship. We endured floods and fires and storms. But\nthrough it all, we have seen the beauty of America\'s soul, and the steel\nin America\'s spine.</p>\n\n<p>Each test has forged new American heroes to remind us who we are, and\nshow us what we can be.</p>\n\n<p>We saw the volunteers of the "Cajun Navy," racing to the rescue with\ntheir fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a devastating\nhurricane.</p>\n\n<p>We saw strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the Las\nVegas strip.</p>\n\n<p>We heard tales of Americans like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee\nLeppert, who is here tonight in the gallery with Melania. Ashlee was\naboard one of the first helicopters on the scene in Houston during\nHurricane Harvey. Through 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee braved live\npower lines and deep water, to help save more than 40 lives. Thank you,\nAshlee.</p>\n\n<p>We heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg. He is here\nwith us too. David faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60\nchildren trapped at a California summer camp threatened by wildfires.</p>\n\n<p>To everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico,\nthe Virgin Islands, California, and everywhere else -- we are with you,\nwe love you, and we will pull through together.</p>\n\n<p>Some trials over the past year touched this chamber very personally.\nWith us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this\nHouse -- a guy who took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work\nthree and a half months later: the legend from Louisiana, Congressman\nSteve Scalise.</p>\n\n<p>We are incredibly grateful for the heroic efforts of the Capitol Police\nOfficers, the Alexandria Police, and the doctors, nurses, and paramedics\nwho saved his life, and the lives of many others in this room.</p>\n\n<p>In the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together, not as\nRepublicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people. But it\nis not enough to come together only in times of tragedy. Tonight, I call\nupon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground,\nand to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people we were\nelected to serve.</p>\n\n<p>Over the last year, the world has seen what we always knew: that no\npeople on Earth are so fearless, or daring, or determined as Americans.\nIf there is a mountain, we climb it. If there is a frontier, we cross\nit. If there is a challenge, we tame it. If there is an opportunity, we\nseize it.</p>\n\n<p>So let us begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our Union is\nstrong because our people are strong.</p>\n\n<p>And together, we are building a safe, strong, and proud America.</p>\n\n<p>Since the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including\n200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone. After years of wage stagnation,\nwe are finally seeing rising wages.</p>\n\n<p>Unemployment claims have hit a 45-year low. African-American\nunemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded, and Hispanic\nAmerican unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history.</p>\n\n<p>Small business confidence is at an all-time high. The stock market has\nsmashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion in value. That is\ngreat news for Americans\' 401k, retirement, pension, and college savings\naccounts.</p>\n\n<p>And just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months\nago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history.</p>\n\n<p>Our massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and\nsmall businesses.</p>\n\n<p>To lower tax rates for hardworking Americans, we nearly doubled the\nstandard deduction for everyone. Now, the first $24,000 earned by a\nmarried couple is completely tax-free. We also doubled the child tax\ncredit.</p>\n\n<p>A typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced\nby $2,000 -- slashing their tax bill in half.</p>\n\n<p>This April will be the last time you ever file under the old broken\nsystem -- and millions of Americans will have more take-home pay\nstarting next month.</p>\n\n<p>We eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans\nmaking less than $50,000 a year -- forcing them to pay tremendous\npenalties simply because they could not afford government-ordered health\nplans. We repealed the core of disastrous Obamacare -- the individual\nmandate is now gone.</p>\n\n<p>We slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21\npercent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone in the\nworld. These changes alone are estimated to increase average family\nincome by more than $4,000.</p>\n\n<p>Small businesses have also received a massive tax cut, and can now\ndeduct 20 percent of their business income.</p>\n\n<p>Here tonight are Steve Staub and Sandy Keplinger of Staub Manufacturing\n-- a small business in Ohio. They have just finished the best year in\ntheir 20-year history. Because of tax reform, they are handing out\nraises, hiring an additional 14 people, and expanding into the building\nnext door.</p>\n\n<p>One of Staub\'s employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight. Corey is\nan all-American worker. He supported himself through high school, lost\nhis job during the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub, where\nhe trained to become a welder. Like many hardworking Americans, Corey\nplans to invest his taxcut raise into his new home and his two\ndaughters\' education. Please join me in congratulating Corey.</p>\n\n<p>Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten\ntax cut bonuses -- many of them thousands of dollars per worker. Apple\nhas just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in\nAmerica, and hire another 20,000 workers.</p>\n\n<p>This is our new American moment. There has never been a better time to\nstart living the American Dream.</p>\n\n<p>So to every citizen watching at home tonight -- no matter where you have\nbeen, or where you come from, this is your time. If you work hard, if\nyou believe in yourself, if you believe in America, then you can dream\nanything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve anything.</p>\n\n<p>Tonight, I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have,\nand what kind of Nation we are going to be. All of us, together, as one\nteam, one people, and one American family.</p>\n\n<p>We all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the\nsame great American flag.</p>\n\n<p>Together, we are rediscovering the American way.</p>\n\n<p>In America, we know that faith and family, not government and\nbureaucracy, are the center of the American life. Our motto is "in God\nwe trust."</p>\n\n<p>And we celebrate our police, our military, and our amazing veterans as\nheroes who deserve our total and unwavering support.</p>\n\n<p>Here tonight is Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old boy from Redding,\nCalifornia, who noticed that veterans\' graves were not marked with flags\non Veterans Day. He decided to change that, and started a movement that\nhas now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of our great heroes. Preston:\na job well done.</p>\n\n<p>Young patriots like Preston teach all of us about our civic duty as\nAmericans. Preston\'s reverence for those who have served our Nation\nreminds us why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts\nfor the pledge of allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national\nanthem.</p>\n\n<p>Americans love their country. And they deserve a Government that shows\nthem the same love and loyalty in return.</p>\n\n<p>For the last year we have sought to restore the bonds of trust between\nour citizens and their Government.</p>\n\n<p>Working with the Senate, we are appointing judges who will interpret the\nConstitution as written, including a great new Supreme Court Justice,\nand more circuit court judges than any new administration in the history\nof our country.</p>\n\n<p>We are defending our Second Amendment, and have taken historic actions\nto protect religious liberty.</p>\n\n<p>And we are serving our brave veterans, including giving our veterans\nchoice in their healthcare decisions. Last year, the Congress passed,\nand I signed, the landmark VA Accountability Act. Since its passage, my\nAdministration has already removed more than 1,500 VA employees who\nfailed to give our veterans the care they deserve -- and we are hiring\ntalented people who love our vets as much as we do.</p>\n\n<p>I will not stop until our veterans are properly taken care of, which has\nbeen my promise to them from the very beginning of this great journey.</p>\n\n<p>All Americans deserve accountability and respect -- and that is what we\nare giving them. So tonight, I call on the Congress to empower every\nCabinet Secretary with the authority to reward good workers -- and to\nremove Federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the\nAmerican people.</p>\n\n<p>In our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more\nregulations in our first year than any administration in history.</p>\n\n<p>We have ended the war on American Energy -- and we have ended the war on\nclean coal. We are now an exporter of energy to the world.</p>\n\n<p>In Detroit, I halted Government mandates that crippled America\'s\nautoworkers -- so we can get the Motor City revving its engines once\nagain.</p>\n\n<p>Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United\nStates -- something we have not seen for decades. Chrysler is moving a\nmajor plant from Mexico to Michigan; Toyota and Mazda are opening up a\nplant in Alabama. Soon, plants will be opening up all over the country.\nThis is all news Americans are unaccustomed to hearing -- for many\nyears, companies and jobs were only leaving us. But now they are coming\nback.</p>\n\n<p>Exciting progress is happening every day.</p>\n\n<p>To speed access to breakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs, last\nyear the FDA approved more new and generic drugs and medical devices\nthan ever before in our history.</p>\n\n<p>We also believe that patients with terminal conditions should have\naccess to experimental treatments that could potentially save their\nlives.</p>\n\n<p>People who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to\ncountry to seek a cure -- I want to give them a chance right here at\nhome. It is time for the Congress to give these wonderful Americans the\n"right to try."</p>\n\n<p>One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription\ndrugs. In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we\npay in the United States. That is why I have directed my Administration\nto make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of our top\npriorities. Prices will come down.</p>\n\n<p>America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade\ndeals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our\njobs, and our Nation\'s wealth.</p>\n\n<p>The era of economic surrender is over.</p>\n\n<p>From now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair and to be\nreciprocal.</p>\n\n<p>We will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones.</p>\n\n<p>And we will protect American workers and American intellectual property,\nthrough strong enforcement of our trade rules.</p>\n\n<p>As we rebuild our industries, it is also time to rebuild our crumbling\ninfrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>America is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building in\njust 1 year -- is it not a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just\nto get a permit approved for a simple road?</p>\n\n<p>I am asking both parties to come together to give us the safe, fast,\nreliable, and modern infrastructure our economy needs and our people\ndeserve.</p>\n\n<p>Tonight, I am calling on the Congress to produce a bill that generates\nat least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment we need.</p>\n\n<p>Every Federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with State and\nlocal governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector\ninvestment -- to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit.</p>\n\n<p>Any bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process --\ngetting it down to no more than two years, and perhaps even one.</p>\n\n<p>Together, we can reclaim our building heritage. We will build gleaming\nnew roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways across our land.\nAnd we will do it with American heart, American hands, and American\ngrit.</p>\n\n<p>We want every American to know the dignity of a hard day\'s work. We want\nevery child to be safe in their home at night. And we want every citizen\nto be proud of this land that we love.</p>\n\n<p>We can lift our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to\nindependence, and from poverty to prosperity.</p>\n\n<p>As tax cuts create new jobs, let us invest in workforce development and\njob training. Let us open great vocational schools so our future workers\ncan learn a craft and realize their full potential. And let us support\nworking families by supporting paid family leave.</p>\n\n<p>As America regains its strength, this opportunity must be extended to\nall citizens. That is why this year we will embark on reforming our\nprisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second\nchance.</p>\n\n<p>Struggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be\nhelped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of\nAmerican workers and American families.</p>\n\n<p>For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our\nmost vulnerable communities. They have allowed millions of low-wage\nworkers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans.\nMost tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives.</p>\n\n<p>Here tonight are two fathers and two mothers: Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy\nCuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens. Their two teenage\ndaughters -- Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens -- were close friends on Long\nIsland. But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa\'s 16th Birthday,\nneither of them came home. These two precious girls were brutally\nmurdered while walking together in their hometown. Six members of the\nsavage gang MS13 have been charged with Kayla and Nisa\'s murders. Many\nof these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to\nenter the country as unaccompanied alien minors - and wound up in Kayla\nand Nisa\'s high school.</p>\n\n<p>Evelyn, Elizabeth, Freddy, and Robert: Tonight, everyone in this chamber\nis praying for you. Everyone in America is grieving for you. And 320\nmillion hearts are breaking for you. We cannot imagine the depth of your\nsorrow, but we can make sure that other families never have to endure\nthis pain.</p>\n\n<p>Tonight, I am calling on the Congress to finally close the deadly\nloopholes that have allowed MS13, and other criminals, to break into\nour country. We have proposed new legislation that will fix our\nimmigration laws, and support our ICE and Border Patrol Agents, so that\nthis cannot ever happen again.</p>\n\n<p>The United States is a compassionate nation. We are proud that we do\nmore than any other country to help the needy, the struggling, and the\nunderprivileged all over the world. But as President of the United\nStates, my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, and my constant\nconcern is for America\'s children, America\'s struggling workers, and\nAmerica\'s forgotten communities. I want our youth to grow up to achieve\ngreat things. I want our poor to have their chance to rise.</p>\n\n<p>So tonight, I am extending an open hand to work with members of both\nparties -- Democrats and Republicans -- to protect our citizens of every\nbackground, color, religion, and creed. My duty, and the sacred duty of\nevery elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans -- to\nprotect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right\nto the American Dream. Because Americans are dreamers too.</p>\n\n<p>Here tonight is one leader in the effort to defend our country: Homeland\nSecurity Investigations Special Agent Celestino Martinez -- he goes by\nCJ. CJ served 15 years in the Air Force before becoming an ICE agent and\nspending the last 15 years fighting gang violence and getting dangerous\ncriminals off our streets. At one point, MS13 leaders ordered CJ\'s\nmurder. But he did not cave to threats or fear. Last May, he commanded\nan operation to track down gang members on Long Island. His team has\narrested nearly 400, including more than 220 from MS13.</p>\n\n<p>CJ: Great work. Now let us get the Congress to send you some\nreinforcements.</p>\n\n<p>Over the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an\nimmigration reform package.</p>\n\n<p>In recent months, my Administration has met extensively with both\nDemocrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration\nreform. Based on these discussions, we presented the Congress with a\ndetailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair\ncompromise -- one where nobody gets everything they want, but where our\ncountry gets the critical reforms it needs.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the four pillars of our plan:</p>\n\n<p>The first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to\ncitizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by\ntheir parents at a young age -- that covers almost three times more\npeople than the previous administration. Under our plan, those who meet\neducation and work requirements, and show good moral character, will be\nable to become full citizens of the United States.</p>\n\n<p>The second pillar fully secures the border. That means building a wall\non the Southern border, and it means hiring more heroes like CJ to keep\nour communities safe. Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes\nexploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country -- and it\nfinally ends the dangerous practice of "catch and release."</p>\n\n<p>The third pillar ends the visa lottery -- a program that randomly hands\nout green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of\nour people. It is time to begin moving towards a merit-based immigration\nsystem -- one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who\nwill contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our\ncountry.</p>\n\n<p>The fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain\nmigration. Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring\nin virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives. Under our plan, we\nfocus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and\nminor children. This vital reform is necessary, not just for our\neconomy, but for our security, and our future.</p>\n\n<p>In recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by\nthe visa lottery and chain migration. In the age of terrorism, these\nprograms present risks we can no longer afford.</p>\n\n<p>It is time to reform these outdated immigration rules, and finally bring\nour immigration system into the 21st century.</p>\n\n<p>These four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise, and one that\nwill create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system.</p>\n\n<p>For over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to solve this\nproblem. This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen.</p>\n\n<p>Most importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that\nfulfills my ironclad pledge to only sign a bill that puts America first.\nSo let us come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job\ndone.</p>\n\n<p>These reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of\nopioid and drug addiction.</p>\n\n<p>In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses: 174 deaths per day.\nSeven per hour. We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if\nwe are going to succeed in stopping this scourge.</p>\n\n<p>My Administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping\nget treatment for those in need. The struggle will be long and difficult\n-- but, as Americans always do, we will prevail.</p>\n\n<p>As we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the\nbest in America.</p>\n\n<p>We see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets\nfamily of New Mexico. Ryan Holets is 27 years old, and an officer with\nthe Albuquerque Police Department. He is here tonight with his wife\nRebecca. Last year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless\nwoman preparing to inject heroin. When Ryan told her she was going to\nharm her unborn child, she began to weep. She told him she did not know\nwhere to turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby.</p>\n\n<p>In that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him: "You will do it --\nbecause you can." He took out a picture of his wife and their four kids.\nThen, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca. In an instant, she agreed\nto adopt. The Holets named their new daughter Hope.</p>\n\n<p>Ryan and Rebecca: You embody the goodness of our Nation. Thank you, and\ncongratulations.</p>\n\n<p>As we rebuild America\'s strength and confidence at home, we are also\nrestoring our strength and standing abroad.</p>\n\n<p>Around the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals\nlike China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our\nvalues. In confronting these dangers, we know that weakness is the\nsurest path to conflict, and unmatched power is the surest means of our\ndefense.</p>\n\n<p>For this reason, I am asking the Congress to end the dangerous defense\nsequester and fully fund our great military.</p>\n\n<p>As part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear\narsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and\npowerful that it will deter any acts of aggression. Perhaps someday in\nthe future there will be a magical moment when the countries of the\nworld will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons.\nUnfortunately, we are not there yet.</p>\n\n<p>Last year, I also pledged that we would work with our allies to\nextinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth. One year later, I am proud\nto report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated almost 100\npercent of the territory once held by these killers in Iraq and Syria.\nBut there is much more work to be done. We will continue our fight until\nISIS is defeated.</p>\n\n<p>Army Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight. Near Raqqa last\nNovember, Justin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were\non a mission to clear buildings that ISIS had rigged with explosives so\nthat civilians could return to the city.</p>\n\n<p>Clearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was severely\nwounded by an explosion. Immediately, Justin bounded into the\nbooby-trapped building and found Kenton in bad shape. He applied\npressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an airway. He then\nperformed CPR for 20 straight minutes during the ground transport and\nmaintained artificial respiration through 2 hours of emergency surgery.</p>\n\n<p>Kenton Stacy would have died if not for Justin\'s selfless love for a\nfellow warrior. Tonight, Kenton is recovering in Texas. Raqqa is\nliberated. And Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a "V" for\n"Valor." Staff Sergeant Peck: All of America salutes you.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are\nevil. When possible, we annihilate them. When necessary, we must be able\nto detain and question them. But we must be clear: Terrorists are not\nmerely criminals. They are unlawful enemy combatants. And when captured\noverseas, they should be treated like the terrorists they are.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds of dangerous\nterrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield -- including the\nISIS leader, al-Baghdadi.</p>\n\n<p>So today, I am keeping another promise. I just signed an order directing\nSecretary Mattis to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep\nopen the detention facilities at Guantnamo Bay.</p>\n\n<p>I am also asking the Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS\nand al-Qa\'ida, we continue to have all necessary power to detain\nterrorists -- wherever we chase them down.</p>\n\n<p>Our warriors in Afghanistan also have new rules of engagement. Along\nwith their heroic Afghan partners, our military is no longer undermined\nby artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies our plans.</p>\n\n<p>Last month, I also took an action endorsed unanimously by the Senate\njust months before: I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.</p>\n\n<p>Shortly afterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly against America\'s sovereign right to make this\nrecognition. American taxpayers generously send those same countries\nbillions of dollars in aid every year.</p>\n\n<p>That is why, tonight, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to\nhelp ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American\ninterests, and only go to America\'s friends.</p>\n\n<p>As we strengthen friendships around the world, we are also restoring\nclarity about our adversaries.</p>\n\n<p>When the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt\ndictatorship, I did not stay silent. America stands with the people of\nIran in their courageous struggle for freedom.</p>\n\n<p>I am asking the Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the\nterrible Iran nuclear deal.</p>\n\n<p>My Administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and\nsocialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela.</p>\n\n<p>But no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally\nthan the cruel dictatorship in North Korea.</p>\n\n<p>North Korea\'s reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon\nthreaten our homeland.</p>\n\n<p>We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from\nhappening.</p>\n\n<p>Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only\ninvite aggression and provocation. I will not repeat the mistakes of\npast administrations that got us into this dangerous position.</p>\n\n<p>We need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime\nto understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America\nand our allies.</p>\n\n<p>Otto Warmbier was a hardworking student at the University of Virginia.\nOn his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a tour to North Korea.\nAt its conclusion, this wonderful young man was arrested and charged\nwith crimes against the state. After a shameful trial, the dictatorship\nsentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to\nAmerica last June -- horribly injured and on the verge of death. He\npassed away just days after his return.</p>\n\n<p>Otto\'s Parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are with us tonight -- along\nwith Otto\'s brother and sister, Austin and Greta. You are powerful\nwitnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength\ninspires us all. Tonight, we pledge to honor Otto\'s memory with American\nresolve.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this\nregime. His name is Mr. Ji Seong-ho.</p>\n\n<p>In 1996, Seong-ho was a starving boy in North Korea. One day, he tried\nto steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food. In\nthe process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger.\nHe woke up as a train ran over his limbs. He then endured multiple\namputations without anything to dull the pain. His brother and sister\ngave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt\nthemselves -- permanently stunting their own growth. Later, he was\ntortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit\nto China. His tormentors wanted to know if he had met any Christians. He\nhad -- and he resolved to be free.</p>\n\n<p>Seong-ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches across China and\nSoutheast Asia to freedom. Most of his family followed. His father was\ncaught trying to escape, and was tortured to death.</p>\n\n<p>Today he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors, and\nbroadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears the most - the truth.</p>\n\n<p>Today he has a new leg, but Seong-ho, I understand you still keep those\ncrutches as a reminder of how far you have come. Your great sacrifice is\nan inspiration to us all.</p>\n\n<p>Seong-ho\'s story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to\nlive in freedom.</p>\n\n<p>It was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave\nbirth to a special place called America. It was a small cluster of\ncolonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness. But it was\nhome to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea: that they could\nrule themselves. That they could chart their own destiny. And that,\ntogether, they could light up the world.</p>\n\n<p>That is what our country has always been about. That is what Americans\nhave always stood for, always strived for, and always done.</p>\n\n<p>Atop the dome of this Capitol stands the Statue of Freedom. She stands\ntall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought and\nlived and died to protect her.</p>\n\n<p>Monuments to Washington and Jefferson -- to Lincoln and King.</p>\n\n<p>Memorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga -- to young Americans\nwho shed their blood on the shores of Normandy, and the fields beyond.\nAnd others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies\nover Asia.</p>\n\n<p>And freedom stands tall over one more monument: this one. This Capitol.\nThis living monument to the American people.</p>\n\n<p>A people whose heroes live not only in the past, but all around us --\ndefending hope, pride, and the American way.</p>\n\n<p>They work in every trade. They sacrifice to raise a family. They care\nfor our children at home. They defend our flag abroad. They are strong\nmoms and brave kids. They are firefighters, police officers, border\nagents, medics, and Marines.</p>\n\n<p>But above all else, they are Americans. And this Capitol, this city, and\nthis Nation, belong to them.</p>\n\n<p>Our task is to respect them, to listen to them, to serve them, to\nprotect them, and to always be worthy of them.</p>\n\n<p>Americans fill the world with art and music. They push the bounds of\nscience and discovery. And they forever remind us of what we should\nnever forget: The people dreamed this country. The people built this\ncountry. And it is the people who are making America great again.</p>\n\n<p>As long as we are proud of who we are, and what we are fighting for,\nthere is nothing we cannot achieve.</p>\n\n<p>As long as we have confidence in our values, faith in our citizens, and\ntrust in our God, we will not fail.</p>\n\n<p>Our families will thrive.</p>\n\n<p>Our people will prosper.</p>\n\n<p>And our Nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and\nfree.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you, and God bless America.\n</p>\n\t\t\t<div class="textNav"><a href="#top">^ Return to top</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>\n\t<div id="footer"><strong><em>State of the Union</em></strong> is a project\n\t\tby Brad Borevitz at <a href="http://www.onetwothree.net">onetwothree.net</a></div>\n</div>\n<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">\n</script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n_uacct = "UA-410742-1";\nurchinTracker();\n</script>\n</body>\n<!-- InstanceEnd -->\n</html>\n'
