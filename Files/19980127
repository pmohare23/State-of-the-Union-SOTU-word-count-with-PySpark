Clinton</h2>\n\t\t\t<h3>January 27, 1998</h3>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p>\nMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of the 105th Congress,\ndistinguished guests, my fellow Americans:</p>\n\n<p>Since the last time we met in this chamber, America has lost two patriots\nand fine public servants. Though they sat on opposite sides of the aisle,\nRepresentatives Walter Capps and Sonny Bono shared a deep love for this\nHouse and an unshakable commitment to improving the lives of all our\npeople.</p>\n\n<p>In the past few weeks, they have both been eulogized. Tonight, I think we\nshould begin by sending a message to their families and their friends that\nwe celebrate their lives, and give thanks for their service to our nation.</p>\n\n<p>For 209 years, it has been the president\'s duty to report to you on the\nstate of the union. Because of the hard work and high purpose of the\nAmerican people, these are good times for America. We have more than 14\nmillion new jobs, the lowest unemployment in 24 years, the lowest core\ninflation in 30 years, incomes are rising and we have the highest home\nownership in history. Crime has dropped for a record five years in a row,\nand the welfare rolls are at their lowest levels in 27 years. Our\nleadership in the world is unrivaled. Ladies and gentlemen, the state of\nour union is strong.</p>\n\n<p>But with barely 700 days left in the 20th century, this is not a time to\nrest. It is a time to build--to build the America within reach, an America\nwhere everybody has a chance to get ahead, with hard work; where every\ncitizen can live in a safe community; where families are strong, schools\nare good, and all our young people can go on to college; an America where\nscientists find cures for diseases from diabetes to Alzheimer\'s to AIDS; an\nAmerica where every child can stretch a hand across a keyboard and reach\nevery book ever written, every painting ever painted, every symphony ever\ncomposed; where government provides opportunity and citizens honor the\nresponsibility to give something back to their communities; an America\nwhich leads the world to new heights of peace and prosperity.</p>\n\n<p>This is the America we have begun to build. This is the America we can\nleave to our children--if we join together to finish the work at hand. Let\nus strengthen our nation for the 21st century.</p>\n\n<p>Rarely have Americans lived through so much change in so many ways in so\nshort a time. Quietly, but with gathering force, the ground has shifted\nbeneath our feet as we have moved into an information age, a global\neconomy, a truly new world.</p>\n\n<p>For five years now, we have met the challenge of these changes as Americans\nhave at every turning point in our history, by renewing the very idea of\nAmerica, widening the circle of opportunity, deepening the meaning of our\nfreedom, forging a more perfect union. We shaped a new kind of government\nfor the information age. I thank the vice president for his leadership, and\nthe Congress for its support, in building a government that is leaner, more\nflexible, a catalyst for new ideas, and most of all, a government that\ngives the American people the tools they need to make the most of their own\nlives.</p>\n\n<p>We have moved past the sterile debate between those who say government is\nthe enemy and those who say government is the answer. My fellow Americans,\nwe have found a third way. We have the smallest government in 35 years, but\na more progressive one. We have a smaller government but a stronger\nnation.</p>\n\n<p>We are moving steadily toward a an even stronger America in the 21st\ncentury--an economy that offers opportunity, a society rooted in\nresponsibility, and a nation that lives as a community.</p>\n\n<p>First, Americans in this chamber and across this nation have pursued a new\nstrategy for prosperity: fiscal discipline to cut interest rates and spur\ngrowth; investments in education and skills, in science and technology and\ntransportation, to prepare our people for the new economy; new markets for\nAmerican products and American workers.</p>\n\n<p>When I took office, the deficit for 1998 was projected to be $357 billion,\nand heading higher. This year, our deficit is projected to be $10 billion,\nand heading lower.</p>\n\n<p>For three decades, six presidents have come before you to warn of the\ndamage deficits pose to our nation. Tonight, I come before you to announce\nthat the federal deficit, once so incomprehensively large that it had 11\nzeros, will be simply zero.</p>\n\n<p>I will submit to Congress, for 1999, the first balanced budget in 30\nyears.</p>\n\n<p>And if we hold fast to fiscal discipline, we may balance the budget this\nyear--four years ahead of schedule.</p>\n\n<p>You can all be proud of that, because turning a sea of red ink into black\nis no miracle. It is the product of hard work by the American people, and\nof two visionary actions in Congress: The courageous vote in 1993 that led\nto a cut in the deficit of 90 percent and the truly historic bipartisan\nbalanced budget agreement passed by this Congress.</p>\n\n<p>Here\'s the really good news: If we maintain our resolve, we will produce\nbalanced budgets as far as the eye can see.</p>\n\n<p>We must not go back to unwise spending or untargeted tax cuts that risk\nreopening the deficit. Last year, together, we enacted targeted tax cuts so\nthat the typical middle class family will now have the lowest tax rates in\n20 years.</p>\n\n<p>My plan to balance the budget next year includes both new investments and\nnew tax cuts targeted to the needs of working families: for education, for\nchild care, for the environment.</p>\n\n<p>But whether the issue is tax cuts or spending, I ask all of you to meet\nthis test: approve only those priorities that can actually be accomplished\nwithout adding a dime to the deficit.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if we balance the budget for next year, it is projected that we\'ll\nthen have a sizeable surplus in the years that immediately follow. What\nshould we do with this projected surplus?</p>\n\n<p>I have a simple four-word answer: Save Social Security first.</p>\n\n<p>Tonight, I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus--that\'s\nevery penny of any surplus--until we have taken all the necessary measures\nto strengthen the Social Security system for the 21st century.</p>\n\n<p>Let us say--let us say to all Americans watching tonight, whether you\'re\n70 or 50, or whether you just started paying into the system, Social\nSecurity will be there when you need it. Let us make this commitment:\nSocial Security first. Let\'s do that--together.</p>\n\n<p>I also want to say that all the American people who are watching us tonight\nshould be invited to join in this discussion, in facing these issues\nsquarely and forming a true consensus on how we should proceed. We\'ll start\nby conducting nonpartisan forums in every region of the country, and I hope\nthat lawmakers of both parties will participate. We\'ll hold a White House\nconference on Social Security in December. And one year from now, I will\nconvene the leaders of Congress to craft historic bipartisan legislation to\nachieve a landmark for our generation, a Social Security system that is\nstrong in the 21st century.</p>\n\n<p>In an economy that honors opportunity, all Americans must be able to reap\nthe rewards of prosperity. Because these times are good, we can afford to\ntake one simple, sensible step to help millions of workers struggling to\nprovide for their families. We should raise the minimum wage.</p>\n\n<p>The information age is first and foremost an education age, in which\neducation will start at birth and continue throughout a lifetime. Last\nyear, from this podium, I said that education has to be our highest\npriority. I laid out a 10-point plan to move us forward, and urged all of\nus to let politics stop at the schoolhouse door.</p>\n\n<p>Since then, this Congress--across party lines--and the American people\nhave responded, in the most important year for education in a generation--\nexpanding public school choice, opening the way to 3,000 charter schools,\nworking to connect every classroom in the country to the information\nsuperhighway, committing to expand Head Start to a million children,\nlaunching America Reads, sending literally thousands of college students\ninto our elementary schools to make sure all our 8-year-olds can read.</p>\n\n<p>Last year I proposed--and you passed--220,000 new Pell Grant scholarships\nfor deserving students. Student loans, already less expensive and easier to\nrepay--now you get to deduct the interest. Families all over America now can\nput their savings into new, tax-free education IRAs.</p>\n\n<p>And this year, for the first two years of college, families will get a\n$1500 tax credit--a Hope Scholarship that will cover the cost of most\ncommunity college tuition. And for junior and senior year, graduate school,\nand job training, there is a lifetime learning credit. You did that, and\nyou should be very proud of it.</p>\n\n<p>And because of these actions, I have something to say to every family\nlistening to us tonight: your children can go on to college. If you know a\nchild from a poor family, tell her not to give up, she can go on to\ncollege. If you know a young couple struggling with bills, worried they\nwon\'t be able to send their children to college, tell them not to give up,\ntheir children can go on to college. If you know somebody who\'s caught in a\ndead-end job and afraid he can\'t afford the classes necessary to get better\njobs for the rest of his life, tell him not to give up, he can go on to\ncollege.</p>\n\n<p>Because of the things that have been done, we can make college as universal\nin the 21st century as high school is today. And, my friends, that will\nchange the face and future of America.</p>\n\n<p>We have opened wide the doors of the world\'s best system of higher\neducation. Now we must make our public elementary and secondary schools the\nworld\'s best as well--by raising standards, raising expectations and raising\naccountability.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to the actions of this Congress last year, we will soon have, for\nthe very first time, a voluntary national test based on national standards\nin fourth grade reading and eighth grade math.</p>\n\n<p>Parents have a right to know whether their children are mastering the\nbasics. And every parent already knows the key; good teachers and small\nclasses.</p>\n\n<p>Tonight, I propose the first ever national effort to reduce class size in\nthe early grades. My balanced budget will help to hire a hundred thousand\nnew teachers who have passed the state competency tests. Now with these\nteachers--listen--with these teachers, we will actually be able to reduce\nclass size in the first, second and third grades to an average of 18\nstudents a class all across America.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if I\'ve got the math right, more teachers teaching smaller classes\nrequires more classrooms. So I also propose a school construction tax cut\nto help communities modernize or build 5,000 schools.</p>\n\n<p>We must also demand greater accountability. When we promote a child from\ngrade to grade who hasn\'t mastered the work, we don\'t do that child any\nfavors. It is time to end social promotion in America\'s schools.</p>\n\n<p>Last year, in Chicago, they made that decision--not to hold our children\nback, but to lift them up. Chicago stopped social promotion and started\nmandatory summer school to help students who are behind to catch up.</p>\n\n<p>I propose to help other communities follow Chicago\'s lead. Let\'s say to\nthem stop promoting children who don\'t learn, and we will give you the\ntools to make sure they do.</p>\n\n<p>I also ask this Congress to support our efforts to enlist colleges and\nuniversities to reach out to disadvantaged children starting in the sixth\ngrade so that they can get the guidance and hope they need so they can know\nthat they, too, will be able to go on to college.</p>\n\n<p>As we enter the 21st century, the global economy requires us to seek\nopportunity not just at home, but in all the markets of the world. We must\nshape this global economy, not shrink from it.</p>\n\n<p>In the last five years, we have led the way in opening new markets, with\n240 trade agreements that remove foreign barriers to products bearing the\nproud stamp, "Made in the USA." Today, record high exports account for\nfully one-third of our economic growth. I want to keep them going, because\nthat\'s the way to keep America growing and to advance a safer, more stable\nworld.</p>\n\n<p>Now, all of you know, whatever your views are, that I think this is a great\nopportunity for America. I know there is opposition to more comprehensive\ntrade agreements. I have listened carefully, and I believe that the\nopposition is rooted in two fears: first, that our trading partners will\nhave lower environmental and labor standards, which will give them an\nunfair advantage in our market and do their own people no favors, even if\nthere\'s more business; and second, that if we have more trade, more of our\nworkers will lose their jobs and have to start over.</p>\n\n<p>I think we should seek to advance worker and environmental standards around\nthe world. It should--I have made it abundantly clear that it should be a\npart of our trade agenda, but we cannot influence other countries\'\ndecisions if we send them a message that we\'re backing away from trade with\nthem.</p>\n\n<p>This year I will send legislation to Congress, and ask other nations to\njoin us, to fight the most intolerable labor practice of all-abusive child\nlabor.</p>\n\n<p>We should also offer help and hope to those Americans temporarily left\nbehind with the global marketplace or by the march of technology, which may\nhave nothing to do with trade. That\'s why we have more than doubled funding\nfor training dislocated workers since 1993. And if my new budget is\nadopted, we will triple funding. That\'s why we must do more, and more\nquickly, to help workers who lose their jobs for whatever reason.</p>\n\n<p>You know, we help communities in a special way when their military base\ncloses. We ought to help them in the same way if their factory closes.\nAgain, I ask the Congress to continue its bipartisan work to consolidate\nthe tangle of training programs we have today into one single GI Bill for\nWorkers, a simple skills grant so people can, on their own, move quickly to\nnew jobs, to higher incomes and brighter futures.</p>\n\n<p>Now, we all know in every way in life change is not always easy, but we\nhave to decide whether we\'re going to try to hold it back and hide from it,\nor reap its benefits. And remember the big picture here: while we\'ve been\nentering into hundreds of new trade agreements, we\'ve been creating\nmillions of new jobs. So this year we will forge new partnerships with\nLatin America, Asia and Europe, and we should pass the new African Trade\nAct. It has bipartisan support.</p>\n\n<p>I will also renew my request for the fast-track negotiating authority\nnecessary to open more new markets, created more new jobs, which every\npresident has had for two decades.</p>\n\n<p>You know, whether we like it or not, in ways that are mostly positive, the\nworld\'s economies are more and more interconnected and interdependent.\nToday, an economic crisis anywhere can affect economies everywhere. Recent\nmonths have brought serious financial problems to Thailand, Indonesia,\nSouth Korea and beyond.</p>\n\n<p>Now why should Americans be concerned about this?</p>\n\n<p>First, these countries are our customers. If they sink into recession, they\nwon\'t be able to buy the goods we\'d like to sell them.</p>\n\n<p>Second, they\'re also our competitors, so if their currencies lose their\nvalue and go down, then the price of their goods will drop, flooding our\nmarket and others with much cheaper goods, which makes it a lot tougher for\nour people to compete.</p>\n\n<p>And finally, they are our strategic partners. Their stability bolsters our\nsecurity.</p>\n\n<p>The American economy remains sound and strong, and I want to keep it that\nway. But because the turmoil in Asia will have an impact on all the world\'s\neconomies, including ours, making that negative impact as small as possible\nis the right thing to do for America, and the right thing to do for a safer\nworld.</p>\n\n<p>Our policy is clear: no nation can recover if it does not reform itself,\nbut when nations are willing to undertake serious economic reform, we\nshould help them do it. So I call on Congress to renew America\'s commitment\nto the International Monetary Fund.</p>\n\n<p>And I think we should say to all the people we\'re trying to represent here,\nthat preparing for a far off storm that may reach our shores is far wiser\nthan ignoring the thunder \'til the clouds are just overhead.</p>\n\n<p>A strong nation rests on the rock of responsibility. A society rooted in\nresponsibility must first promote the value of work, not welfare. We could\nbe proud that after decades of finger-pointing and failure, together we\nended the old welfare system. And we\'re now replacing welfare checks with\npaychecks.</p>\n\n<p>Last year, after a record four-year decline in welfare rolls I challenged\nour nation to move two million more Americans off welfare by the year 2000.\nI\'m pleased to report we have also met that goal two full years ahead of\nschedule.</p>\n\n<p>This is a grand achievement, the sum of many acts of individual courage,\npersistence and hope.</p>\n\n<p>For 13 years, Elaine Kinslow of Indianapolis, Indiana was on and off\nwelfare. Today she\'s a dispatcher with a van company. She\'s saved enough\nmoney to move her family into a good neighborhood. And she\'s helping other\nwelfare recipients go to work.</p>\n\n<p>Elaine Kinslow and all those like her are the real heroes of the welfare\nrevolution. There are millions like her all across America, and I am happy\nshe could join the first lady tonight. Elaine, we\'re very proud of you.\nPlease stand up.</p>\n\n<p>We still have a lot more to do, all of us, to make welfare reform a\nsuccess; providing child care, helping families move closer to available\njobs, challenging more companies to join our Welfare to Work Partnership,\nincreasing child-support collections from deadbeat parents who have a duty\nto support their own children. I also want to thank Congress for restoring\nsome of the benefits to immigrants who are here legally and working hard.\nAnd I hope you will finish that job this year.</p>\n\n<p>We have to make it possible for all hard-working families to meet their\nmost important responsibilities. Two years ago, we helped guarantee that\nAmericans can keep their health insurance when they changed jobs. Last\nyear, we extended health care to up to 5 million children. This year, I\nchallenge Congress to take the next historic steps. A hundred and sixty\nmillion of our fellow citizens are in managed care plans. These plans save\nmoney, and they can improve care. But medical decisions ought to be made by\nmedical doctors, not insurance company accountants.</p>\n\n<p>I urge this Congress to reach across the aisle and write into law a\nconsumer bill of rights that says this: You have the right to know all your\nmedical options, not just the cheapest. You have the right to choose the\ndoctor you want for the care you need. You have the right to emergency room\ncare wherever and whenever you need it. You have the right to keep your\nmedical records confidential.</p>\n\n<p>Now, traditional care or managed care, every American deserves quality\ncare. Millions of Americans between the ages of 55 and 65 have lost their\nhealth insurance. Some are retired. Some are laid off. Some lose their\ncoverage when their spouses retire. After a lifetime of work, they\'re left\nwith nowhere to turn.</p>\n\n<p>So I ask the Congress, let these hard-working Americans buy into the\nMedicare system. It won\'t add a dime to the deficit, but the peace of mind\nit will provide will be priceless.</p>\n\n<p>Next, we must help parents protect their children from the gravest health\nthreat that they face: an epidemic of teen smoking spread by multimillion\ndollar marketing campaigns. I challenge Congress. Let\'s pass bipartisan,\ncomprehensive legislation that will improve public health, protect our\ntobacco farmers, and change the way tobacco companies do business forever.</p>\n\n<p>Let\'s do what it takes to bring teen smoking down. Let\'s raise the price of\ncigarettes by up to $1.50 a pack over the next 10 years, with penalties on\nthe tobacco industry if it keeps marketing to our children.</p>\n\n<p>Now tomorrow, like every day, 3,000 children will start smoking, and a\nthousand will die early as a result. Let this Congress be remembered as the\nCongress that saved their lives.</p>\n\n<p>In the new economy, most parents work harder than ever. They face a\nconstant struggle to balance their obligations to be good workers, and\ntheir even more important obligations to be good parents.</p>\n\n<p>The Family and Medical Leave Act was the very first bill I was privileged\nto sign into law as president in 1993. Since then, about 15 million people\nhave taken advantage of it, and I\'ve met a lot of them all across this\ncountry. I ask you to extend the law to cover 10 million more workers, and\nto give parents time off when they have to go see their children\'s teachers\nor take them to the doctor.</p>\n\n<p>Child care is the next frontier we must face to enable people to succeed at\nhome and at work. Last year, I co-hosted the very first White House\nconference on child care with one of our foremost experts, America\'s first\nlady. From all corners of America, we heard the same message--without regard\nto region or income or political affiliation--we\'ve got to raise the quality\nof child care, we\'ve got to make it safer, we\'ve got to make it more\naffordable.</p>\n\n<p>So here\'s my plan: Help families to pay for child care for a million more\nchildren; scholarships and background checks for child-care workers, and a\nnew emphasis on early learning; tax credits for businesses that provide\nchild care for their employees; and a larger child-care tax credit for\nworking families.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if you pass my plan, what this means is that a family of four with an\nincome of $35,000 and high child-care costs will no longer pay a single\npenny of federal income tax.</p>\n\n<p>You know, I think this is such a big issue with me because of my own\npersonal experience. I have often wondered how my mother, when she was a\nyoung widow, would have been able to go away to school and get an education\nand come back and support me, if my grandparents hadn\'t been able to take\ncare of me. She and I were really very lucky.</p>\n\n<p>How many other families have never had that same opportunity? The truth is,\nwe don\'t know the answer to that question, but we do know what the answer\nshould be. Not a single American family should ever have to choose between\nthe job they need and the child they love.</p>\n\n<p>A society rooted in responsibility must provide safe streets, safe schools,\nand safe neighborhoods. We pursued a strategy of more police, tougher\npunishment, smarter prevention with crime-fighting partnerships, with local\nlaw enforcement and citizen groups, where the rubber hits the road.</p>\n\n<p>I can report to you tonight that it\'s working. Violent crime is down,\nrobbery is down, assault is down, burglary is down for five years in a row\nall across America. Now, we need to finish the job of putting 100,000 more\npolice on our streets.</p>\n\n<p>Again, I ask Congress to pass a juvenile crime bill that provides more\nprosecutors and probation officers to crack down on gangs and guns and\ndrugs and bar violent juveniles from buying guns for life. And I ask you to\ndramatically expand our support for after-school programs. I think every\nAmerican should know that most juvenile crime is committed between the\nhours of 3:00 in the afternoon and 8:00 at night. We can keep so many of\nour children out of trouble in the first place if we give them some place\nto go other than the streets, and we ought to do it.</p>\n\n<p>Drug use is on the decline. I thank General McCaffrey for his leadership,\nand I thank this Congress for passing the largest anti-drug budget in\nhistory. Now I ask you to join me in a ground-breaking effort to hire a\nthousand new Border Patrol agents and to deploy the most sophisticated\navailable new technologies to help close the door on drugs at our borders.</p>\n\n<p>Police, prosecutors, and prevention programs, good as they are, they can\'t\nwork if our court system doesn\'t work. Today, there are large numbers of\nvacancies in our federal courts. Here is what the chief justice of the\nUnited States wrote: "Judicial vacancies cannot remain at such high levels\nindefinitely without eroding the quality of justice."</p>\n\n<p>I simply ask the United States Senate to heed this plea and vote on the\nhighly qualified nominees before you, up or down.</p>\n\n<p>We must exercise responsibility not just at home but around the world. On\nthe eve of a new century, we have the power and the duty to build a new era\nof peace and security. But make no mistake about it; today\'s possibilities\nare not tomorrow\'s guarantees. America must stand against the poisoned\nappeals of extreme nationalism. We must combat an unholy access of new\nthreats from terrorists, international criminals and drug traffickers.</p>\n\n<p>These 21st century predators feed on technology and the free flow of\ninformation and ideas and people, and they will be all the more lethal if\nweapons of mass destruction fall into their hands. To meet these\nchallenges, we are helping to write international rules of the road for the\n21st century, protecting those who join the family of nations and isolating\nthose who do not.</p>\n\n<p>Within days, I will ask the Senate for its advice and consent to make\nHungary, Poland and the Czech Republic the newest members of NATO. For 50\nyears, NATO contained communism and kept America and Europe secure. Now\nthese three formerly communist countries have said yes to democracy. I ask\nthe Senate to say yes to them, our new allies.</p>\n\n<p>By taking in new members and working closely with new partners, including\nRussia and Ukraine, NATO can help to assure that Europe is a stronghold for\npeace in the 21st century.</p>\n\n<p>Next, I will ask Congress to continue its support for our troops and their\nmission in Bosnia. This Christmas, Hillary and I traveled to Sarajevo with\nSenator and Mrs. Dole and a bipartisan congressional delegation. We saw\nchildren playing in the streets where, two years ago, they were hiding from\nsnipers and shells. The shops were filled with food. The cafes were alive\nwith conversation. The progress there is unmistakable; but it is not yet\nirreversible.</p>\n\n<p>To take firm root, Bosnia\'s fragile peace still needs the support of\nAmerican and allied troops when the current NATO mission ends in June. I\nthink Senator Dole actually said it best. He said: "This is like being\nahead in the fourth quarter of a football game; now is not the time to walk\noff the field and forfeit the victory."</p>\n\n<p>I wish all of you could have seen our troops in Tuzla. They\'re very proud\nof what they are doing in Bosnia, and we\'re all very proud of them. One of\nthose--one of those brave soldiers is sitting with the first lady tonight:\nArmy Sergeant Michael Tolbert. His father was a decorated Vietnam vet.\nAfter college in Colorado, he joined the Army. Last year he led an infantry\nunit that stopped a mob of extremists from taking over a radio station that\nis a voice of democracy and tolerance in Bosnia. Thank you very much,\nSergeant, for what you represent.</p>\n\n<p>In Bosnia and around the world, our men and women in uniform always do\ntheir mission well. Our mission must be to keep them well-trained and\nready, to improve their quality of life, and to provide the 21st century\nweapons they need to defeat any enemy.</p>\n\n<p>I ask Congress to join me in pursuing an ambitious agenda to reduce the\nserious threat of weapons of mass destruction. This year, four decades\nafter it was first proposed by President Eisenhower, a Comprehensive\nNuclear Test Ban is within reach. By ending nuclear testing, we can help to\nprevent the development of new and more dangerous weapons, and make it more\ndifficult for non-nuclear states to build them.</p>\n\n<p>I am pleased to announce that four former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of\nStaff--Generals John Shalikashvili, Colin Powell and David Jones, and\nAdmiral William Crowe--have endorsed this treaty, and I ask the Senate to\napprove it this year.</p>\n\n<p>Together we must also confront the new hazards of chemical and biological\nweapons, and the outlaw states, terrorists and organized criminals seeking\nto acquire them.</p>\n\n<p>Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade, and much of his\nnation\'s wealth, not on providing for the Iraqi people, but on developing\nnuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them.</p>\n\n<p>The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job,\nfinding and destroying more of Iraq\'s arsenal than was destroyed during the\nentire gulf war. Now, Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing\ntheir mission.</p>\n\n<p>I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats,\nwhen I say to Saddam Hussein, "You cannot defy the will of the world," and\nwhen I say to him, "You have used weapons of mass destruction before; we\nare determined to deny you the capacity to use them again."</p>\n\n<p>Last year, the Senate ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention to protect\nour soldiers and citizens from poison gas. Now we must act to prevent the\nuse of disease as a weapon of war and terror. The Biological Weapons\nConvention has been in effect for 23 years now. The rules are good, but the\nenforcement is weak. We must strengthen it with a new international\ninspection system to detect and deter cheating. In the months ahead, I will\npursue our security strategy with old allies in Asia and Europe, and new\npartners from Africa to India and Pakistan, from South America to China.\nAnd from Belfast to Korea to the Middle East, America will continue to\nstand with those who stand for peace.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, it\'s long past time to make good on our debt to the United\nNations.</p>\n\n<p>More and more we are working with other nations to achieve common goals. If\nwe want America to lead, we\'ve got to set a good example. As we see--as we\nsee so clearly in Bosnia, allies who share our goals can also share our\nburdens. In this new era, our freedom and independence are actually\nenriched, not weakened, by our increasing interdependence with other\nnations. But we have to do our part.</p>\n\n<p>Our founders set America on a permanent course toward a more perfect union.\nTo all of you, I say, it is a journey we can only make together, living as\none community.</p>\n\n<p>First, we have to continue to reform our government, the instrument of our\nnational community. Everyone knows elections have become too expensive,\nfueling a fund-raising arms race.</p>\n\n<p>This year, by March the 6th, at long last the Senate will actually vote on\nbipartisan campaign finance reform proposed by senators McCain and\nFeingold. Let\'s be clear; a vote against McCain-Feingold is a vote for soft\nmoney and for the status quo. I ask you to strengthen our democracy and\npass campaign finance reform this year.</p>\n\n<p>But at least equally important, we have to address the real reason for the\nexplosion in campaign costs: the high cost of media advertising. I will--\nfor the folks watching at home, those were the groans of pain in the\naudience--I will formally request that the Federal Communications\nCommission act to provide free or reduced-cost television time--for\ncandidates who observe spending limits voluntarily. The airwaves are a\npublic trust, and broadcasters also have to help us in this effort to\nstrengthen our democracy.</p>\n\n<p>Under the leadership of Vice President Gore, we have reduced the federal\npayroll by 300,000 workers, cut 16,000 pages of regulation, eliminated\nhundreds of programs and improved the operations of virtually every\ngovernment agency. But we can do more.</p>\n\n<p>Like every taxpayer, I\'m outraged by the reports of abuses by the IRS. We\nneed some changes there: new citizen advocacy panels, a stronger taxpayer\nadvocate, phone lines open 24 hours a day, relief for innocent taxpayers.</p>\n\n<p>Last year, by an overwhelming bipartisan margin, the House of\nRepresentatives passed sweeping IRS reforms. This bill must not now\nlanguish in the Senate. Tonight, I ask the Senate: Follow the House; pass\nthe bipartisan package as your first order of business. I hope to goodness\nbefore I finish I can think of something to say \'Follow the Senate\' on so\nI\'ll be out of trouble!</p>\n\n<p>A nation that lives as a community must value all its communities. For the\npast five years, we have worked to bring the spark of private enterprise to\ninner city and poor rural areas with community development banks, more\ncommercial loans into poor neighborhoods, cleanup of polluted sites for\ndevelopment.</p>\n\n<p>Under the continued leadership of the vice president, we propose to triple\nthe number of empowerment zones to give business incentives to invest in\nthose areas. We should. We should also give poor families more help to move\ninto homes of their own, and we should use tax cuts to spur the\nconstruction of more low-income housing.</p>\n\n<p>Last year, this Congress took strong action to help the District of\nColumbia. Let us renew our resolve to make our capital city a great city\nfor all who live and visit here.</p>\n\n<p>Our cities are the vibrant hubs of great metropolitan areas. They are still\nthe gateway for new immigrants from every continent who come here to work\nfor their own American dreams. Let\'s keep our cities going strong into the\n21st Century. They\'re a very important part of our future.</p>\n\n<p>Our communities are only as healthy as the air our children breathe, the\nwater they drink, the Earth they will inherit. Last year we put in place\nthe toughest-ever controls on smog and soot. We moved to protect\nYellowstone, the Everglades, Lake Tahoe. We expanded every community\'s\nright to know about toxics that threaten their children.</p>\n\n<p>Just yesterday, our food safety plan took effect, using new science to\nprotect consumers from dangers like e. coli and salmonella.</p>\n\n<p>Tonight, I ask you to join me in launching a new Clean Water initiative, a\nfar-reaching effort to clean our rivers, our lakes and our coastal waters\nfor our children.</p>\n\n<p>Our overriding environmental challenge tonight is the worldwide problem of\nclimate change, global warming, the gathering crisis that requires\nworldwide action. The vast majority of scientists have concluded\nunequivocally that if we don\'t reduce the emission of greenhouse gases at\nsome point in the next century, we\'ll disrupt our climate and put our\nchildren and grandchildren at risk.</p>\n\n<p>This past December, America led the world to reach a historic agreement\ncommitting our nation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through market\nforces, new technologies, energy efficiency.</p>\n\n<p>We have it in our power to act right here, right now. I propose $6 billion\nin tax cuts, in research and development, to encourage innovation,\nrenewable energy, fuel-efficient cars, energy-efficient homes. Every time\nwe have acted to heal our environment, pessimists have told us it would\nhurt the economy. Well, today our economy is the strongest in a generation,\nand our environment is the cleanest in a generation. We have always found a\nway to clean the environment and grow the economy at the same time. And\nwhen it comes to global warming, we\'ll do it again.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, community means living by the defining American value, the ideal\nheard \'round the world: that we\'re all created equal. Throughout our\nhistory, we haven\'t always honored that ideal, and we\'ve never fully lived\nup to it. Often it\'s easier to believe that our differences matter more\nthan what we have in common. It may be easier, but it\'s wrong.</p>\n\n<p>What we have to do in our day and generation to make sure that America\ntruly becomes one nation, what do we have to do? We\'re becoming more and\nmore and more diverse. Do you believe we can become one nation? The answer\ncannot be to dwell on our differences, but to build on our shared values.</p>\n\n<p>And we all cherish family and faith, freedom and responsibility. We all\nwant our children to grow up in the world where their talents are matched\nby their opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>I\'ve launched this national initiative on race to help us recognize our\ncommon interests and to bridge the opportunity gaps that are keeping us\nfrom becoming one America. Let us begin by recognizing what we still must\novercome.</p>\n\n<p>Discrimination against any American is un-American. We must vigorously\nenforce the laws that make it illegal. I ask your help to end the backlog\nat the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Sixty thousand of our\nfellow citizens are waiting in line for justice, and we should act now to\nend their wait.</p>\n\n<p>We should also recognize that the greatest progress we can make toward\nbuilding one America lies in the progress we make for all Americans,\nwithout regard to race. When we open the doors of college to all Americans,\nwhen we rid all our streets of crime, when there are jobs available to\npeople from all our neighborhoods, when we make sure all parents have the\nchild care they need, we\'re helping to build one nation.</p>\n\n<p>We in this chamber and in this government must do all we can to address the\ncontinuing American challenge to build one America. But we\'ll only move\nforward if all our fellow citizens, including every one of you at home\nwatching tonight, is also committed to this cause.</p>\n\n<p>We must work together, learn together, live together, serve together. On\nthe forge of common enterprise, Americans of all backgrounds can hammer out\na common identity.</p>\n\n<p>We see it today in the United States military, in the Peace Corps, in\nAmeriCorps. Wherever people of all races and backgrounds come together in a\nshared endeavor and get a fair chance, we do just fine. With shared values\nand meaningful opportunities and honest communications and citizen service,\nwe can unite a diverse people in freedom and mutual respect. We are many.\nWe must be one.</p>\n\n<p>In that spirit, let us lift our eyes to the new millennium. How will we\nmark that passage? It just happens once every thousand years. This year,\nHillary and I launched the White House Millennium Program to promote\nAmerica\'s creativity and innovation and to preserve our heritage and\nculture into the 21st century. Our culture lives in every community, and\nevery community has places of historic value that tell our stories as\nAmericans. We should protect them.</p>\n\n<p>I am proposing a public-private partnership to advance our arts and\nhumanities and to celebrate the millennium by saving America\'s treasures\ngreat and small. And while we honor the past, let us imagine the future.</p>\n\n<p>Now, think about this. The entire store of human knowledge now doubles\nevery five years. In the 1980s, scientists identified the gene causing\ncystic fibrosis; it took nine years. Last year, scientists located the gene\nthat causes Parkinson\'s disease--in only nine days! Within a decade, gene\nchips will offer a road map for prevention of illnesses throughout a\nlifetime. Soon, we\'ll be able to carry all the phone calls on Mother\'s Day\non a single strand of fiber the width of a human hair. A child born in 1998\nmay well live to see the 22nd century.</p>\n\n<p>Tonight, as part of our gift to the millennium, I propose a 21st Century\nresearch fund for pathbreaking scientific inquiry, the largest funding\nincrease in history for the National Institutes of Health, the National\nScience Foundation, and the National Cancer Institute. We have already\ndiscovered we have already discovered genes for breast cancer and diabetes.\nI ask you to support this initiative so ours will be the generation that\nfinally wins the war against cancer and begins a revolution in our fight\nagainst all deadly diseases.</p>\n\n<p>As important as all this scientific progress is, we must continue to see\nthat science serves humanity, not the other way around. We must prevent the\nmisuse of genetic tests to discriminate against any American, and we must\nratify the ethical consensus of the scientific and religious communities,\nand ban the cloning of human beings.</p>\n\n<p>We should enable all the world\'s people to explore the far reaches of\ncyberspace. Think of this: the first time I made a State of the Union\nspeech to you, only a handful of physicists used the World Wide Web--\nliterally just a handful of people.</p>\n\n<p>Now in schools and libraries, homes and businesses, millions and millions\nof Americans surf the Net every day.</p>\n\n<p>We must give parents the tools they need to help protect their children\nfrom inappropriate material on the Net, but we also must make sure that we\nprotect the exploding, global commercial potential of the Internet. We can\ndo the kinds of things that we need to do and still protect our kids. For\none thing, I ask Congress to step up support for building the next\ngeneration Internet. It\'s getting kind of clogged, you know. And the next\ngeneration Internet will operate at speeds up to a thousand times faster\nthan today.</p>\n\n<p>Even as we explore this inner space, in the new millennium we\'re going to\nopen new frontiers in outer space.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout all history, human kind has had only one place to call home: our\nplanet Earth. Beginning this year, 1998, men and women from 16 countries\nwill build a foothold in the heavens--the International Space Station. With\nits vast expanses, scientists and engineers will actually set sail on an\nuncharted sea of limitless mystery and unlimited potential.</p>\n\n<p>And this October, a true American hero, a veteran pilot of 149 combat\nmissions and one five-hour space flight that changed the world, will return\nto the heavens. Godspeed, John Glenn!</p>\n\n<p>John, you will carry with you America\'s hopes, and on your uniform once\nagain you will carry America\'s flag, marking the unbroken connection\nbetween the deeds of America\'s past and the daring of America\'s future.</p>\n\n<p>Nearly 200 years ago, a tattered flag, its broad stripes and bright stars\nstill gleaming through the smoke of a fierce battle, moved Francis Scott\nKey to scribble a few words on the back of an envelope, the words that\nbecame our National Anthem. Today, that Star-Spangled Banner, along with\nthe Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights,\nare on display just a short walk from here. They are America\'s treasures.\nAnd we must also save them for the ages.</p>\n\n<p>I ask all Americans to support our project to restore all our treasures so\nthat the generations of the 21st century can see for themselves the images\nand the words that are the old and continuing glory of America, an America\nthat has continued to rise through every age against every challenge, a\npeople of great works and greater possibilities, who have always, always\nfound the wisdom and strength to come together as one nation, to widen the\ncircle of opportunity, to deepen the meaning of our freedom, to form that\nmore perfect union.</p>\n\n<p>Let that be our gift to the 21st century.</p>\n\n<p>God bless you, and God bless the United States.\n</p>\n\t\t\t<div class="textNav"><a href="#top">^ Return to top</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>\n\t<div id="footer"><strong><em>State of the Union</em></strong> is a project\n\t\tby Brad Borevitz at <a href="http://www.onetwothree.net">onetwothree.net</a></div>\n</div>\n<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">\n</script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n_uacct = "UA-410742-1";\nurchinTracker();\n</script>\n</body>\n<!-- InstanceEnd -->\n</html>\n'
