Bush</h2>\n\t\t\t<h3>January 31, 1990</h3>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p>\nTonight, I come not to speak about the "State of the Government", not to\ndetail every new initiative we plan for the coming year, nor describe every\nline in the budget. I\'m here to speak to you and to the American people\nabout the State of the Union about our world, the changes we\'ve seen, the\nchallenges we face. And what that means for America.</p>\n\n<p>There are singular moments in history, dates that divide all that goes\nbefore from all that comes after. And many of us in this chamber have lived\nmuch of our lives in a world whose fundamental features were defined in\n1945. And the events of that year decreed the shape of nations, the pace of\nprogress, freedom or oppression for millions of people around the world.</p>\n\n<p>Nineteen Forty-Five provided the common frame of reference the compass\npoints of the postwar era we\'ve relied upon to understand ourselves. And\nthat was our world until now. The events of the year just ended, the\nRevolution of \'89, have been a chain reaction, changes so striking that it\nmarks the beginning of a new era in the world\'s affairs.</p>\n\n<p>Think back think back just twelve short months ago to the world we knew as\n1989 began.</p>\n\n<p>One year, one year ago the people of Panama lived in fear under the thumb\nof a dictator. Today democracy is restored. Panama is free.</p>\n\n<p>"Operation Just Cause" has achieved its objective. And the number of\nmilitary personel in Panama is now very close to what it was before the\noperation began. And tonight I am announcing that before the end of\nFebruary the additional numbers of American troops, the brave men and women\nof our armed forces who made this mission a success, will be back home.</p>\n\n<p>A year ago in Poland, Lech Walesa declared he was ready to open a dialogue\nwith the Communist rulers of that country. And today, with the future of a\nfree Poland in their own hands, members of Solidarity lead the Polish\ngovernment.</p>\n\n<p>And a year ago, freedom\'s playwright, Vaclav Havel, languished as a\nprisoner in Prague. And today it\'s Vaclav Havel, President of\nCzechoslovakia.</p>\n\n<p>And one year ago Erich Honecker of East Germany claimed history as his\nguide. He predicted the Berlin Wall would last another hundred years. And\ntoday, less than one year later, it\'s the wall that\'s history.</p>\n\n<p>Remarkable events, remarkable events, events that fulfill the long-held\nhopes of the American people. Events that validate the longstanding goals\nof American policy, a policy based upon a single shining principle: the\ncause of freedom.</p>\n\n<p>America, not just the nation, but an idea alive in the minds of the people,\neverywhere. As this new world takes shape, America stands at the center of\na widening circle of freedom, today, tomorrow and into the next century.</p>\n\n<p>Our nation is the enduring dream of every immigrant who ever set foot on\nthese shores, and the millions still struggling to be free. This nation,\nthis idea called America was and always will be a new world, our new\nworld.</p>\n\n<p>At a workers\' rally in a place called Branik on the outskirts of Prague the\nidea called America is alive. A worker, dressed in grimy overalls, rises to\nspeak at the factory gates. And he begins his speech to his fellow citizens\nwith these words, words of a distant revolution: "We hold these truths to\nbe self-evident. That all men are created equal, that they are endowed by\ntheir creator with certain unalienable rights, and that among these are\nlife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." It\'s no secret here at home\nfreedom\'s door opened long ago. The cornerstones of this free society have\nalready been set in place: democracy, competition, opportunity, private\ninvestment, stewardship, and of course, leadership.</p>\n\n<p>And our challenge today is to take this democratic system of ours, a system\nsecond to none, and make it better:</p>\n\n<p>A better America where there\'s a job for whoever wants one;</p>\n\n<p>Where women working outside the home can be confident their children are\nin safe and loving care, and where Government works to expand child\nalternatives for parents.</p>\n\n<p>Where we reconcile the needs of a clean environment and a strong economy.</p>\n\n<p>Where "Made in the USA" is recognized around the world as the symbol of\nquality and progress,</p>\n\n<p>And where every one of us enjoys the same opportunities to live, to work\nand to contribute to society. And where, for the first time, the American\nmainstream includes all of our disabled citizens.</p>\n\n<p>Where everyone has a roof over his head, and where the homeless get the\nhelp they need to live in dignity.</p>\n\n<p>Where our schools challenge and support our kids and our teachers, and\nevery one of them makes the grade,</p>\n\n<p>Where every street, every city, every school and every child is drug-free.</p>\n\n<p>And finally, and finally, where no American is forgotten. Our hearts go out\nto our hostages, our hostages who are ceaselessly in our minds and in our\nefforts. That\'s part of the future we want to see, the future we can make\nfor ourselves. But dreams alone won\'t get us there. We need to extend our\nhorizon, to commit to the long view. And our mission for the future starts\ntoday.</p>\n\n<p>In the tough competitive markets around the world, America faces the great\nchallenges and great opportunities. And we know that we can succeed in the\nglobal economic arena of the 90\'s. But to meet that challenge we must make\nsome fundamental changes, some crucial investments in ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, we are going to invest in America. This Administration is determined\nto encourage the creation of capital, capital of all kinds. Physical\ncapital: everything from our farms and factories to our workshops and\nproduction lines, all that is needed to produce and deliver quality goods\nand quality services. Intellectual, intellectual capital: the source of\nideas that spark tomorrow\'s products. And of course human capital: the\ntalented work force that we\'ll need to compete in the global market.</p>\n\n<p>And let me tell you, if we ignore human capital, if we lose the spirit of\nAmerican ingenuity, the sprit that is the hallmark of the AMERICAN worker,\nthat would be bad. The American worker is the most productive worker in the\nworld.</p>\n\n<p>We need to save more. We need to expand the pool of capital for new\ninvestments that mean more jobs and more growth. And that\'s the idea behind\nthe new initiative I call the Family Savings Plan, which I will send to\nCongress tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>We need to cut the tax on capital gains, encourage, encourage risk-takers,\nespecially those in small businesses, to take those steps that translate\ninto economic reward, jobs, and a better life for all of us.</p>\n\n<p>We\'ll do what it takes to invest in America\'s future. The budget commitment\nis there. The money is there. It\'s there for research and development, R\nand D, a record high. It\'s there for our housing initiative, hope, H-O-P-E,\nto help everyone from first-time homebuyers to the homeless. The money\'s\nthere to keep our kids drug-free, 70 percent more than when I took office\nin 1989. It\'s there for space exploration, and its there for education,\nanother record high.</p>\n\n<p>And one more, and one more thing. Last fall at the education summit, the\ngovernors and I agreed to look for ways to help make sure that our kids are\nready to learn the very first day they walk into the classroom. And I\'ve\nmade good on that commitment by proposing a record increase in funds, an\nextra half billion dollars, for something near and dear to all of us: Head\nStart.</p>\n\n<p>Education is the one investment that means more for our future, because it\nmeans the most for our children. Real improvement in our schools is not\nsimply a matter of spending more. It\'s a matter of asking more, expecting\nmore, of our schools, our teachers, of our kids, of our parents and of\nourselves. And that\'s why tonight, and that\'s why tonight, I am announcing\nAmerica\'s education goals, goals developed with enormous cooperation from\nthe nation\'s governors. And if I might I\'d like to say I\'m very pleased\nthat Governor Gardner and Governor Clinton, Governor Branstad, Governor\nCampbell, all of whom were very key in these discussion, these\ndeliberations, are with us here tonight.</p>\n\n<p>By the, by the year 2000, every child must start school ready to learn. The\nUnited States must increase the high school graduation rate to no less than\n90 percent. And we are going to make sure our schools\' diplomas mean\nsomething. In critical subjects, at the fourth, eighth, and 12th grades, we\nmust assess our students\' performance.</p>\n\n<p>By the, by the year 2000 U.S. students must be the first in the world in\nmath and science achievement. Every American adult must be a skilled,\nliterate worker and citizen. Every school must offer the kind of\ndisciplined environment that makes it possible for our kids to learn. And\nevery school in America must be drug-free.</p>\n\n<p>Ambitious aims? Of course. Easy to do? Far from it. But the future\'s at\nstake. The nation will not accept anything less than excellence in\neducation.</p>\n\n<p>These investments will help keep America competitive. And I know this about\nthe American people: we welcome competition. We\'ll match our ingenuity, our\nenergy, our experience, and technology our spirit and enterprise against\nanyone. But let the competition be free, but let it also be fair. America\nis ready.</p>\n\n<p>Since we really mean it, and since we\'re serious about being ready to meet\nour challenge, we\'re getting our own house in order. We have made real\nprogress. Seven years ago, the Federal deficit was 6 percent of our gross\nnational product, 6 percent. In the new budget I sent up two days ago the\ndeficit is down to 1 percent of GNP.</p>\n\n<p>That budget brings Federal spending under control. It meets the\nGramm-Rudman target. It brings the deficit down further. And balances the\nbudget by 1993, with no new taxes.</p>\n\n<p>And let me tell you, there\'s still more than enough Federal spending. For\nmost of us, $1.2 trillion is still a lot of money.</p>\n\n<p>And once the budget is balanced, we can operate the way every family must\nwhen it has bills to pay. We won\'t leave it to our children and\ngrandchildren. Once it\'s balanced, we will start paying off the national\ndebt.</p>\n\n<p>And there\'s something more, and there\'s something more we owe the\ngenerations of the future: stewardship, the safekeeping of America\'s\nprecious environmental inheritance.</p>\n\n<p>As just one sign of how serious we are, we will elevate the Environmental\nProtection Agency to Cabinet rank. Not, not more bureaucracy, not more red\ntape, but the certainty that here at home, and especially in our dealings\nwith other nations, environmental issues have the status they deserve.</p>\n\n<p>This year\'s budget provides over $2 billion in new spending to protect our\nenvironment, with over $1 billion for global change research, and a new\ninitiative I call America the Beautiful to expand our national parks and\nwildlife preserves and improve recreational facilities on public lands.</p>\n\n<p>And something else, something that will help keep this country clean, from\nour forest land to the inner cities, and keep America beautiful for\ngenerations to come, the money to plant a billion trees a year.</p>\n\n<p>And tonight, and tonight let me say again to all the members of the\nCongress, the American people did not send us here to bicker. There is work\nto do, and they sent us here to get it done. And once again, in the spirit\nof cooperation I offer my hand to all of you. And let\'s work together to do\nthe will of the people--clean air, child care, the educational excellence\nact, crime and drugs. It\'s time to act. The farm bill, transportation\npolicy, product liability reform, enterprise zones. It\'s time to act\ntogether.</p>\n\n<p>And there\'s one thing I hope we can agree on. It\'s about our commitments.\nAnd I\'m talking about Social Security.</p>\n\n<p>To every American out there on Social Security, to every, every American\nsupporting that system today, and to everyone counting on it when they\nretire, we made a promise to you, and we are going to keep it.</p>\n\n<p>We, we rescued the system in 1983 and it\'s sound again, bipartisan\narrangement. Our budget fully funds today\'s benefits and it assures that\nfuture benefits will be funded as well. And the last thing we need to do is\nmess around with Social Security.</p>\n\n<p>There\'s one more problem we need to address. We must give careful\nconsideration to the recommendations of the health care studies under way\nnow. And that\'s why tonight, I am asking Dr. Sullivan, Lou Sullivan,\nSecretary of Health and Human Services, to lead a Domestic Policy Council\nreview of recommendations on the quality, accessibility and cost of our\nnation\'s health care system. I am committed to bring the staggering costs\nof health care under control.</p>\n\n<p>The State of the Government does indeed depend on many of us in this very\nchamber. But the State of the Union depends on all Americans. We must\nmaintain the democratic decency that makes a nation out of millions of\nindividuals. And I\'ve been appalled at the recent mail bombings across this\ncountry. Every one of us must confront and condemn racism, anti-Semitism,\nbigotry and hate. Not next week, not tomorrow, but right now. Every single\none of us.</p>\n\n<p>The State of the Union depends on whether we help our neighbor, claim the\nproblems of our community as our own. We\'ve got to step forward when\nthere\'s trouble, lend a hand, be what I call a point of light to a stranger\nin need. We\'ve got to take the time after a busy day to sit down and read\nwith our kids, help them with their homework, pass along the values we had\nas children. And that\'s how we sustain the State of the Union.</p>\n\n<p>Every effort is important. It all adds up. It\'s doing the things that give\ndemocracy meaning. It all adds up to who we are and who we will be.</p>\n\n<p>And let me say, that so long as we remember the American idea, so long as\nwe live up to the American ideal, the State of the Union will remain sound\nand strong.</p>\n\n<p>And to those who worry that we\'ve lost our way, well, I want you to listen\nto parts of a letter written by James Markwell, Pvt. 1st Class James\nMarkwell, a 20-year-old Army medic to the First Battalion, 75th Rangers.\nIt\'s dated Dec. 18, the day before our armed forces went into action in\nPanama. It\'s a letter servicemen write--and hope will never, ever be sent.\nAnd sadly, Private Markwell\'s mother did receive this letter. She passed it\non to me out there in Cincinnati.</p>\n\n<p>And here is some of what he wrote: "I\'ve never been afraid of death, but I\nknow he is waiting at the corner...I\'ve been trained to kill and to save,\nand so has everyone else. I am frightened of what lays beyond the fog, and\nyet... do not mourn for me. Revel in the life that I have died to give\nyou... But most of all, don\'t forget that the Army was my choice. Something\nthat I wanted to do. Remember I joined the Army to serve my country and\ninure that you are free to do what you want and to live your lives\nfreely."</p>\n\n<p>Let me add that Private Markwell was among the first to see battle in\nPanama, and among the first to fall. But he knew what he believed in. He\ncarried the idea we call America in his heart.</p>\n\n<p>I began tonight speaking about the changes we\'ve seen this past year. There\nis a new world of challenges and opportunities before us. And there is a\nneed for leadership that only America can provide.</p>\n\n<p>Nearly 40 years ago, in his last address to the Congress, President Harry\nTruman predicted such a time would come. He said, "As our world grows\nstronger, more united, more attractive to men on both sides of the Iron\nCurtain, then inevitably there will come a time of change within the\nCommunist world." Today, that change is taking place.</p>\n\n<p>For more than 40 years, America and its allies held Communism in check and\ninsured that democracy would continue to exist. And today, with Communism\ncrumbling, our aim must be to insure democracy\'s advance, to take the lead\nin forging peace and freedom\'s best hope, a great and growing commonwealth\nof free nations.</p>\n\n<p>And to the Congress and to all Americans, I say it is time to acclaim a new\nconsensus at home and abroad, a common vision of the peaceful world we want\nto see.</p>\n\n<p>Here in our own hemisphere it is time for all the people of the Americas,\nNorth and South, to live in freedom.</p>\n\n<p>In the Far East and Africa, it\'s time for the full flowering of free\ngovernments and free markets that have served the engine of progress.</p>\n\n<p>It is time to offer our hand to the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe\nso that continent, for too long a continent divided, can see a future whole\nand free.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s time to build on our new relationship with the Soviet Union, to\nendorse and encourage a peaceful process of internal change toward\ndemocracy and economic opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>We are in a period of great transition, great hope, and yet great\nuncertainty. We recognize that the Soviet military threat in Europe is\ndiminishing, but we see little change in Soviet strategic modernization.\nAnd, therefore, we must sustain our own strategic offense modernization and\nthe Strategic Defense Initiative.</p>\n\n<p>But the time is right to move forward on a conventional arms control\nagreement to move us to more appropriate levels of military forces in\nEurope, a coherent defense program that insures the U.S. will continue to\nbe a catalyst for peaceful change in Europe. And I\'ve consulted with\nleaders of NATO. In fact I spoke by phone with President Gorbachev just\ntoday.</p>\n\n<p>And I agree with our European allies that an American military presence in\nEurope is essential and that it should not be solely tied to the Soviet\nmilitary presence in Eastern Europe.</p>\n\n<p>But our troop levels can still be lower. And so tonight I am announcing a\nmajor new step for a further reduction in U.S. and Soviet manpower in\nCentral and Eastern Europe to 195,000 on each side.</p>\n\n<p>This number, this number, this level, reflects the advice of our senior\nmilitary advisers. It\'s designed to protect American and European interests\nand sustain NATO\'s defense strategy. A swift conclusion to our arms control\ntalks--conventional, chemical and strategic--must now be our goal. And\nthat time has come.</p>\n\n<p>Still, we must recognize an unfortunate fact: in many regions of the world\ntonight the reality is conflict, not peace. Enduring animosities and\nopposing interests remain. And thus the cause of peace must be served by an\nAmerica strong enough and sure enough to defend our interests and our\nideals. It\'s this American idea that for the past four decades helped\ninspire the Revolution of \'89.</p>\n\n<p>And here at home, and in the world, there is history in the making, and\nhistory to be made. Six months ago, early in this season of change, I stood\nat the gates of the Gdansk shipyard in Poland at the monument to the fallen\nworkers of Solidarity. It\'s a monument of simple majesty. Three tall\ncrosses rise up from the stones, and atop each cross, an anchor, an ancient\nsymbol of hope.</p>\n\n<p>The anchor in our world today is freedom. Holding us steady in times of\nchange, a symbol of hope to all the world. And freedom is at the very heart\nof the idea that is America. Giving life to the idea depends on every one\nof us. Our anchor has always been faith and family.</p>\n\n<p>In the last few days of this past monumentous year, our family was blessed\nonce more, celebrating the joy of life when a little boy became our 12th\ngrandchild. When I held the little guy for the first time, the troubles at\nhome and abroad seemed manageable, and totally in perspective.</p>\n\n<p>And now I know, I know you\'re probably thinking, Well, that\'s just a\ngrandfather talking.</p>\n\n<p>Well, maybe you\'re right. But I\'ve met a lot of children this past year\nacross this country, as all of you have. Everywhere from the Far East to\nEastern Europe. All kids are unique. Yet, all kids are alike. The budding\nyoung environmentalist I met this month, who joined me in exploring the\nFlorida Everglades. The Little Leaguers I played catch with in Poland,\nready to go from Warsaw to the World Series. And even the kids who are ill\nor alone--and God bless those boarder babies, born addicted to drugs and\nAIDS--coping with problems no child should have to face. But, you know,\nwhen it comes to hope and the future, every kid is the same: full of\ndreams, ready to take on the world, all special because they are the very\nfuture of freedom. And to them belongs this new world I\'ve been speaking\nabout.</p>\n\n<p>And so tonight, I\'m going to ask something of every one of you. Now let me\nstart with my generation, with the grandparents out there. You are our\nliving link with the past. Tell your grandchildren the story of struggles\nwaged at home and abroad, of sacrifices freely made for freedom\'s sake. And\ntell them your own story as well, because every American has a story to\ntell.</p>\n\n<p>And parents, your children look to you for direction and guidance. Tell\nthem of faith and family. Tell them we are one nation under God. Teach them\nthat of all the many gifts they can receive, liberty is their most precious\nlegacy. And of all the gifts they can give, the greatest, the greatest is\nhelping others.</p>\n\n<p>And to the children and young people out there tonight, with you rests our\nhope, all that America will mean in the years and decades ahead. Fix your\nvision on a new century, your century, on dreams we cannot see, on the\ndestiny that is yours and yours alone.</p>\n\n<p>And finally, let all Americans, all of us here in this chamber, the\nsymbolic center of democracy, affirm our allegiance to this idea we call\nAmerica. And let us remember that the State of the Union depends upon each\nand every one of us.</p>\n\n<p>God bless all of you. And may God bless this great nation, the United\nStates of America.\n</p>\n\t\t\t<div class="textNav"><a href="#top">^ Return to top</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>\n\t<div id="footer"><strong><em>State of the Union</em></strong> is a project\n\t\tby Brad Borevitz at <a href="http://www.onetwothree.net">onetwothree.net</a></div>\n</div>\n<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">\n</script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n_uacct = "UA-410742-1";\nurchinTracker();\n</script>\n</body>\n<!-- InstanceEnd -->\n</html>\n'
